let abstracts = ["Civil society's inability to hold powerful businesses accountable in authoritarian regimes is a grand challenge in today's global environment. We propose that the development of Internet activism provides a novel mechanism to pressure for corporate response in those societies. Internet activism is dispersed, fast moving, and interactive, and hence can effectively focus public attention and potentially undermine a company's public image by generating social comparison. In addition, firms with public image vulnerability may experience magnified pressure from Internet activism, as well as more intense social comparison. We explore this framework in the setting of corporate donations made in the wake of the 2008 earthquake in the Sichuan Province of China, which triggered Internet activismthat challenged corporations to contribute to the good of the community. Analysis based on 613 large publicly listed Chinese firms supports our framework. © Academy of Management Journal.",
       'Digital distribution is a new technology that is revolutionizing the pop-rock music market. Extensive debate exists on the long tail theory that predicts a niche strategy in the pop-rock market versus the conventional wisdom of a “superstar effect” that predicts skewness in the market outcomes for artists. Our research tests the empirical evidence of such effects and elaborates on how the firms respond to this disruptive technological revolution and how this response changes strategic management. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.',
       'We examine if and how incumbent firms respond to entry and entry threats using nonprice modes of competition. Our analysis focuses on airline service quality. We find that incumbent on-time performance (OTP) actually worsens in response to entry, and even entry threats, by Southwest Airlines. Since Southwest is both a top-performing airline in OTP and a low-cost carrier (LCC), we conjecture that this response by incumbents may be due to a cost-cutting strategy that allows for intense postentry price competition along with preentry deterrence, or it may be due to a postentry differentiation strategy along with preentry accommodation. Further analysis of entry and entry threats by other airlines is inconclusive, providing evidence that is partially consistent with both hypotheses. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of worsening OTP can only be observed when the (potential) entrant is a LCC (Southwest, Jet Blue, and AirTran). ©2015 INFORMS.',
       'The objectives of the study are to analyze micro Type II Social Business SPOs’ pre-venture and post-venture experiences, and to demonstrate how they contribute to capturing value while simultaneously pursue two goals, i.e. to uplift the underprivileged and, at the same time, grow into self-sustaining businesses. The research also examines value creation through the focus of their goals on beneficiaries/investors and customers through high and low engagement. The study engages a four-year-long ethnographic approach and conducts in-depth interviews with 28 micro Type II Social Business SPOs in Bangladesh. By exploring the pre-venture stage, the findings illustrate how their drive, obstacles, skill development and gaining of self-dependence motivate social entrepreneurs to leverage their SPO ventures within this context. The post-venture stage identifies four types of business models (non-traditional non-profit, holistic social business, subsistence, and traditional small business), and addresses how Type II Social Business SPOs shape business model value creation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
       'This study linked CEO hubris to firm risk taking and examined the moderating role of managerial discretion in this relationship. Drawing on upper echelons theory and behavioral decision theory, we developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 2,790 CEOs of diverse manufacturing firms in China. The positive relationship between CEO hubris and firm risk taking was found to be stronger when CEO managerial discretion was stronger: when a firm faced munificent but complex markets; had less inertia and more intangible resources; had a CEO who also chaired its board; and had a CEO who was not politically appointed. © 2010 Academy of Management Journal.',
       "Despite the pivotal role of positioning in marketing strategy formulation, few studies explicitly examine positioning strategies employed by foreign and indigenous firms operating in the same cultural milieu. Relying on the concepts of culture and positioning as the backdrop, this research contributes to the literature by answering two key research questions: What are the differences between African indigenous firms' and Africa-based foreign firms' pursuits of positioning strategies? And is a Western-developed typology of positioning strategies applicable in an African cultural milieu, and more specifically, in the Ghanaian cultural environment? The results of the study demonstrate that indigenous and foreign firms replicate each other's positioning strategies to carve out positions, although foreign firms aggressively pursue a wider range of strategies than indigenous firms. While there is a uniform attempt by indigenous and foreign firms to reach the mass-market and lower- to middle-class target audiences, foreign firms focus more on middle-class audiences than do indigenous firms. The authors discuss implications for marketing theory and practice. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",
       "Research summary: Scholars have actively researched the initial public offering (IPO) underpricing phenomenon as it relates to the issuing firm's resource acquisition and entrepreneur's wealth retention. In this study, we attempt to replicate three studies that examine how top management and board-level characteristics impact IPO underpricing using signaling theory. Focusing on a different time period and using a new sample of 234 U.S. IPO firms, we do not find evidence for the signaling effects of top management, governance structure, and social ties on resource acquisition and wealth retention during the IPO process. We propose possible theoretical and empirical reasons for our results and discuss two major external changes that researchers should account in future research. Managerial summary: Past studies on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing have systematically documented the effectiveness of signals (i.e., having seasoned CEO and top management team, director independence, and director network) that influence the amount of money entrepreneurs “leave on the table” during the IPO process. Since these studies were conducted before the ongoing information revolution, we re-examined the effectiveness of these signals in the current IPO market. Despite using similar methodological approaches that past studies used, we do not find evidence supporting the prior findings. To explain our findings, we discuss two notable recent changes—unprecedented access to information and a regulatory change—that future researchers should examine in the context of IPO underpricing research.

       "We examine whether certification by an internationally recognized information intermediary helps emerging-market firms overcome the liability of foreignness in capital markets. Specifically, we ask whether securing a credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) enables these firms to certify their financial reporting quality. We hypothesize that the unique information demands of lenders motivate firms to provide more conservative financial statements upon securing an S&P rating. We find evidence consistent with this conjecture. Moreover, the rating appears to be part of an international expansion strategy for these firms, and is followed by increased international activity in capital and product markets. © 2013 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.",
       'We theorize that anger incited by a social movement, which has a mobilizing effect among outsider activists, might immobilize collective action intentions for institutional insiders—those sympathetic to the movement and employed by its target. We conducted initial field surveys across a spectrum of social movements, including Occupy Wall Street and #metoo, as well as those related to business sustainability and gun control, which showed that institutional insiders are often just as angry as outsider activists. But the evidence from those surveys did not show that social movement anger translated into collective action intentions among institutional insiders. We tested our theory deductively with an experiment conducted with participants who were supportive of social movement issues in their organizations. Overall, our results show that anger about a social movement issue relates to greater collective action intentions among outsider activists but not among institutional insiders. Instead of anger emboldening institutional insiders to act despite the potential costs, anger triggers fear about the potential negative consequences of collective action in the workplace, which in turn results in withdrawal. While social movements often rely on anger frames to mobilize sympathizers, our work suggests that this practice may paradoxically cause fear that immobilizes those uniquely positioned to be able to influence organizations to change. © The Author(s) 2019.',
       "Research Summary: Although patent races of leading technology firms have garnered significant attention in the prior literature, it remains unclear how the outcome of a patent race affects subsequent firm-level innovation. Drawing on agency theory, we propose that losing a patent race drives firms to pursue more technological innovation than winning due to managerial concerns. To investigate the mechanism, we hypothesize that the positive impact of a lost race on a firm's innovation is more pronounced when more shareholders hold near-term investment horizons and when a CEO is less protected against the pressure of shareholders. By constructing a unique dataset of simultaneous patent applications, we find evidence consistent with the proposed theory. Managerial Summary: This study explores the impact of a patent race on the subsequent innovation of leading technology firms. We find that losing firms tend to pursue more innovation after the race, surpassing the winner in terms of innovation. This finding is particularly pronounced when top managers are more pressured by the shareholders. Specifically, we show that the positive effect of a lost race is especially evident in publicly listed companies with a higher ratio of short-term institutional investors and where CEOs have less protection from shareholder pressures in the public market. This research underscores how a setback in a technology competition can act as a catalyst to change innovation dynamics among competitors at the technology frontiers. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
       'Organizations can attempt to improve strategy implementation by developing strategy execution maps, which aim to translate strategic objectives into specific activities and provide sufficient clarity to inform employees’ decisions and actions. However, managers often encounter pitfalls, both in framing the process and in developing maps. This article suggests how to overcome these pitfalls, describes several applications of causal maps to further enhance strategy execution, and illustrates strategy execution maps for organizations with distinctive strategies. © The Regents of the University of California 2021.',
       'This research has two main objectives. The first is to fill the knowledge gap on the role which the external environment plays in the strategic behavior of exporting companies, taking into account the psychological distances between the domestic and foreign markets. The second aim is to clarify the role that market orientation plays in export activity, since the literature review shows conflicting results. The study provides insight into these issues through hypothesis testing of a conceptual model using a sample of 212 Spanish exporting companies. The results lead to two major conclusions: (a) in turbulent environments, exporting firms adapting the marketing mix program to the needs of foreign markets obtain a better export performance in highly competitive and psychologically distant markets; (b) although market orientation has a direct and positive effect on export performance, its main role is to support strategic decision making in exporting companies. In addition, market orientation moderates the relationship between marketing mix adaptation and export performance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.',
       "Using a multi-year qualitative study, I explain how employees at a fast-growing retail organization used creative resourcing - that is, the manipulation and recombination of objects in novel and useful ways to solve problems. I induce two core organizational processes (autonomous resourcing and directed resourcing) that explain how organizations foster ongoing creative activities in response to different perceived resource endowments. In doing so, I add clarity to a mixed literature that argues on the one hand that limited resources foster creativity, and on the other, that abundant resources foster creativity. Instead, I reorient the questions that scholars ask by shifting the conversation away from variance-explanation models and towards understanding organizational processes, specifically around how employees use resources in dynamic ways and how managers enable them to do so. My study unpacks how the link between resources and creativity is rooted deeply in the actions of managers and employees embedded in organizations over time. In elaborating theory around these actions, I contribute to scholarly and practitioner understanding around how organizations foster creativity in a variety of resource environments. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

       "The proliferation of Web-based information sources and social media draw firms' attention to these channels as sources of competitive intelligence (CI). To date, research has focused mainly on information collection techniques rather than on CI uses and its influence on firm performance. We define CI embeddedness as the extent to which management and employees incorporate CI in daily routines, so that actionable knowledge is transferred throughout the organization. A survey of 124 decision makers reveals positive impact of Web CI sources as well as alliances with information providers on CI embeddedness. Furthermore, while CI embeddedness shows no direct influence on firms’ performance, it has a mediated effect on performance through customer satisfaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
       'This paper investigates how the structure of political institutions influences the effectiveness of corporate political lobbying by shaping the "veto points" and "entry points" that lobbying firms encounter and require, respectively, when attempting to influence public policies; in so doing, this study deepens our understanding of the strategic implications of institutional environments. Using large-sample and cross-country firm-level data, we find that the influence of firms\' lobbying activities on public policies is weakened when there are tighter constraints generated as a result of greater political (partisan) competition and more subnational government tiers. We find that the negative association between the effectiveness of lobbying and political (partisan) competition is particularly pronounced in countries with lower electoral accountability and that the negative association between the effectiveness of lobbying and subnational government tiers is particularly pronounced in more centralized political systems. © 2015 INFORMS.',
       'We seek to move beyond the exalted figure of the heroic entrepreneur that predominates the study of entrepreneurship; to take a less agentic view of entrepreneurship; to tell stories rarely told, and to demonstrate how historical and technocultural forces are as instrumental in directing entrepreneurial activity as individual motivations. We enlist the work of Foucault and others, in conjunction with netnographic fieldwork that focuses on an assemblage of young YouTubers striving to become what we call autopreneurs. We reveal how they internalize a structure of feeling, divined from neoliberal ideology that shapes their everyday affairs. We find that three main wellsprings – the dynamics of competition, the creativity dispositif, and technologies of the self – detrimentally affect the quality of their lives and collectively institute a ‘cruel optimism’ which promises much but delivers little. We conclude with some thoughts on the ramifications of our work for the study of entrepreneurship. © 2018 The Authors',
       'Every so often it is useful for a field of study to take the time to self-reflect and consider its existence from a high level in order to re-evaluate and possibly re-direct its resource allocations moving forward (where such reflection has become a wonderful and valuable standard in Strategic Organization!). In this essay, we counter Hambrick’s call to consolidate with a radical suggestion to separate the field of strategic organization into at least two camps. We offer a sound logic for that split and detail its hypothetical positive implications for the field in terms of the possibilities for improved research resource allocation and improved practical impact. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.',
       "Corporates often partner with social media influencers to bolster brand image after crises. Although existing evidence suggests that influencers have largely positive effects on brands, there is paucity of research on the role of influencers in corporate crisis communications. Across two studies, we examine the impact of influencers on consumers’ perception of corporate brands responding to crises. Drawing on persuasion knowledge theory, we identify issues associated with brands engaging influencers, such as inference of manipulative intent, which negatively affects perceived trustworthiness and corporate reputation. The downside of employing influencers in crisis communications is, however, offset by the influencer and brand communicating values-driven motives of their partnership. Our findings imply that corporate brands should respond to crises through a bolstering strategy promoting existing corporate goodwill, without the influencer's involvement. When leveraging influencers’ support, however, brands should endeavor to inoculate against manipulative inferences by communicating values-driven motives behind the brand-influencer partnership. © 2020",
       'Many studies have shown that decision makers have a tendency to choose the default or standard action among several possible actions. The article develops a model to explore under what conditions it is optimal for a firm facing a strategic decision problem to choose the default action without investing in obtaining more information that allows a more accurate decision. The model shows that the strategy to follow the default without additional information ("the default heuristic") is more likely to be optimal when the cost of obtaining information is higher, and when the variation in possible outcomes is lower. The model also analyzes the optimal level of information search, showing that if the firm chooses to obtain information at all, it will invest in more accurate information when the cost of obtaining information is lower and when the variation in possible outcomes is lower. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
       'Teams of business leaders make most strategic decisions in organizations. However, although a large body of research has analyzed cognitive biases of individual leaders, little is known about how those biases affect teams on the group level. Therefore, on the basis of research into group decision making and group diversity, we analyze demographic diversity and group tenure as two important determinants of overconfidence in groups. We report findings from a quasi-experimental field study involving 46 management teams, which suggest that diversity and tenure have separate, direct effects on group overconfidence. More specifically, we show that demographic diversity reduces group overconfidence, while group tenure increases it. These findings add a dynamic dimension to the conceptualization of group overconfidence in teams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd',
       'We propose that individuals differ in their ability to generate creative ideas as a function of the values, beliefs, and norms of their social group’s culture they have adopted and routinely use. To generate creative ideas, an individual needs to think differently from their group to generate novel ideas that others cannot, while understanding what the group will view as appropriate and practical. We view culture as a network of cultural elements and decompose individuals’ cultural adoption into two conceptually and empirically distinct dimensions. Cultural breadth, which reflects whether individuals have adopted a broad range of values, beliefs, and norms that span the organization’s culture, contributes to the novelty required for creativity. Cultural embeddedness, which reflects whether individuals have adopted the core values, beliefs, and norms entrenched in the organization’s culture, helps an individual generate ideas that others will view as useful. We predict that individuals with both high cultural breadth and high cultural embeddedness, who we label integrated cultural brokers, will be most likely to generate creative ideas that are novel and useful. We test and find support for our theory in two contexts: an e-commerce firm in South Korea and MBA students at a U.S. university. © The Author(s) 2023.',
       'The paper considers a model of competition among firms that produce a homogeneous good in a networked environment. A bipartite graph determines which subset of markets a firm can supply to. Firms compete à la Cournot and decide how to allocate their production output to the markets they are directly connected to. We provide a characterization of the production quantities at the unique equilibrium of the resulting game for any given network. Our results identify a novel connection between the equilibrium outcome and supply paths in the underlying network structure. We then proceed to study the impact of changes in the competition structure, for example, due to a firm expanding into a new market or two firms merging, on firms’ profits and consumer surplus. The modeling framework we propose can be used in assessing whether expanding in a new market is profitable for a firm, identifying opportunities for collaboration, for example, a joint venture between competing firms, and guiding regulatory action in the context of market design and antitrust analysis. © 2019 INFORMS',
       'When a government agency considers tightening a standard on a pollutant, the agency often takes into account the proportion of firms that are able to meet the new standard (what we refer to as the industry’s “voluntary adoption level”) because a higher proportion indicates a more feasible standard. We develop a novel model of regulation in which the probability of a stricter standard being enacted increases with an industry’s voluntary adoption level. In addition, in our model, the benefit of a new green technology is both uncertain and correlated across firms, and firms’ decisions exhibit both strategic substitutability (because the marketing benefit of a new green technology decreases as more firms adopt it) and complementarity (because the stricter standard is more likely to be enforced as more firms adopt it). To analyze such strategic interaction among firms’ decisions under correlated and uncertain payoffs, we use the global game framework recently developed in economics. Our analysis shows that regulation that considers an industry’s voluntary adoption level, compared with regulation that ignores it, can more effectively motivate development of a new green technology. Interestingly, uncertainty in the payoff can, in some situations, help promote development of a new green technology. Finally, we find that more aggressive regulation (a higher probability of enforcing a stricter standard for a given voluntary adoption level) encourages more firms to adopt a green technology once the technology becomes available but may discourage a firm from developing it in the first place when facing intense competition. Therefore, for an industry with intense competition, a government agency should exercise caution about being too aggressive with regulation, which could potentially stifle innovation.

       'In this article we turn to practice theory as a new theoretical lens to better understand the complexity of diversity in organizations. Questioning the field’s ontological dualism between individualism and societism, we engage with practice theory’s relational ontology and its main conceptual and methodological ideas. From this we develop a practice-based theory of diversity, arguing that practices and their connections, not individuals or discourses, are the unit of analysis to best study and understand the social life of a diverse organization. We apply this theoretical lens to (in)equality through two research examples, showing how the practicing of career mentoring is connected to other inequality-(re)producing practices and how the equal social order of a dance organization is accomplished through the situated practice of mixing. In the discussion we highlight the value of a practice theory for diversity. A practice-based theory of diversity renews the research agenda of diversity studies, forwarding postdualistic forms of theorizing, reconceptualizing diversity practices along the theoretical logic of practice, and conceiving of diversity-related phenomena as the net effect of social order–producing practices.

       'Formal financial institutions inadequately distribute startup capital to business ventures of ethnic minorities, women, low-educated, and young people. Self-financing groups fill this gap because in these associations agents accumulate their savings into a fund that is later used to provide loans to the members. This study builds and simulates an agent-based model that compares the profitability of businesses started by members of self-financing groups against businesses financed by commercial loans. The results indicate that—besides the self-generation of debt capital—businesses of members of self-financing groups can have higher returns due to the consolidation of social capital and the competitive advantage created through a dual process of homophily. Higher quotas of savings boost profits, but only up to a threshold, after which a bifurcation pattern—typical of complexity dynamics—emerges. The practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed and future research lines are proposed. © 2020 The Author(s)',
       'The management literature has been investigating teams’ human capital resources as a predictor of their task performance. However, our knowledge regarding the precise structure of the human capital-performance relationship, as well as the resource orchestrator role managers play in this relationship, remains limited. In this study, we relax the assumption that human capital resources are used effectively, and conceptually extend the human capital resources construct by distinguishing between gross and active human capital resources. Doing so both helps to better understand the human capital-performance link and clarify the exact role that managers play in this link. Using 98 teams’ data over 2 years (5492 sets of player-level data aggregated to 196 sets of team-level data) from European Big Five football (soccer) leagues, we test our predictions. Our study has implications for the human capital literature as well as for the resource-based view literature on organisational slack. © The Author(s) 2021.',
       'Incompleteness of inductive reasoning presents an enduring dilemma for organizational researchers. We examine two practical reasoning strategies - idealization and contextualization - that can be used at the pinnacle of this dilemma: when theoretical conclusions are drawn from empirical data. Understanding the two strategies can lead to more effective argumentation and evaluation. Appreciating the methodological incompleteness of both strategies, in turn, helps us distinguish between the methodological and the policy dimensions of organization-scientific debates. © Academy of Management Review.',
       'Acquisitions can dramatically reshape interorganizational networks by combining previously separate nodes and allowing the acquirer to inherit the target’s ties, potentially creating network synergy. Network synergy is the extent to which combining an acquirer’s and a target’s networks through node collapse results in a more favorable structural position for the combined firm as the acquirer gains control of the target’s existing ties. We hypothesize that the likelihood of selecting a target increases when the expected network synergy is greater. Using data from the biotechnology industry (1995–2007), we find support for this hypothesis by showing that acquirers prefer targets that generate greater expected increases in network status and greater expected access to structural holes—even when we control for other known sources of synergies. We further show that these effects are driven by complementary combinations of the acquirer’s and target’s networks that go beyond the attractiveness of the target’s network per se. By integrating the networks and acquisitions literatures, we introduce a novel source of synergies, provide evidence of a previously unexplored mechanism of network change, and show how firms can exert agency in the process of network change. © The Author(s) 2018.',
       'This research proposes and tests mechanisms for defining and identifying the critical online consumer reviews that firms could prioritize to optimize their online response strategies, while incorporating the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology to deal with the overwhelming volume of information. Three sets of analytical tools are introduced: Heuristic Processing, Linguistic Feature Analysis, and Deep Learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP), to extract review information. Twelve algorithms to classify critical reviews were developed accordingly and empirically tested for their effectiveness. Our econometric analysis of 110,146 online reviews from a chain operation in hospitality industry over seven years identifies six outstanding algorithms. Firm value rating, comment length, valence, and certain consumer emotions, in addition to past comment-response behavior, are found to be superior in predicting incoming review criticality. However, the service attributes such as urgency to reply and the feasibility of actions to take are not as informative. © 2020',
       "This paper draws on the resource-based view and risk-related research to examine imitation-related configurations that explain performance outcomes in social trading. The study applies qualitative comparative analysis to examine 16,964 investment observations at eToro, the world's largest social trading platform. The results show that the experience and the imitation of traders, in combination with a low risk level, equifinally explain similar performance outcomes.

       "This article reconciles mixed findings about the performance impact of middle managers' strategy involvement. We propose that the relationship between middle managers' adaptive strategy implementation - through upward and downward influence - and objective business performance can be curvilinear and contingent on formal and informal structures. Applying a multilevel perspective to social networks, we empirically show that reputational social capital enhances the performance impact of middle managers' upward influence while informational social capital elevates the performance impact of their downward influence. The size of a business unit or region has differential moderating effects. The curvilinear effects of middle managers' upward influence and reputational and informational social capital on business unit performance reflect paradoxes. We discuss the implications of these findings for strategy implementation research and practice. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'Much has been written about the liabilities of mind wandering in the workplace. Given its prevalence, however, mind wandering may carry underappreciated benefits-especially with respect to creativity. Examining this possibility, we hypothesize that mindwandering involving imaginative thoughts, also known as "daydreams,"has the potential to spur creativity. We develop a theoretical model in which we examine two facets of daydreams based on their content: Problem-oriented daydreams and bizarre daydreams. In addition, wespecify an antecedent condition that produces such daydreams (cognitively demanding work; Studies 1 & 2) as well as a boundary condition of the effects of daydreaming on creativity (professional identification; Study 2). Taken together, the studies reported here largely support our theoretical model. Cognitively demanding work reliably elicits both facets of daydreams. However, only problem-oriented daydreams relate to creativity directly; the relationship between bizarre daydreamsand creativity is entirely dependent on professional identification. In addition, we observe negative relationships between both facets of daydreams and performance more generally when employees lack professional identification (Study 2). Our results indicate that among professionally identified individuals, daydreaming carries noteworthy benefits for creativity but can also impair performance in the absence of identification.  © 2021 Academy of Management Journal.',
       "Research Summary: Given the growing legitimacy of corporate social responsibility (CSR), many firms engage in symbolic communication to showcase CSR without undertaking commensurate substantive actions. This “CSR decoupling” can create a risk of perceived greenwashing, which, in turn, may negatively affect a firm's performance. In this study, we explore an unexamined antecedent of decoupling: interfirm affiliation. Specifically, we use the structure of Business Groups (BGs) to investigate CSR decoupling across rather than within firms. We find that apex firms within a group are more likely to engage in CSR decoupling compared with non-apex firms and, importantly, are partially shielded from greenwashing perceptions by the market. Our research contributes to the literatures on decoupling, perceived greenwashing, and the role of BGs and their CSR practices. Managerial Summary: Companies that engage in symbolic communication about corporate social responsibility (CSR) without substantive actions risk being perceived as “greenwashers,” a perception that harms firm performance. Our study demonstrates how, in certain contexts where firms are affiliated with others, this may not occur. For instance, apex firms within Business Groups (BGs)—where firms are interconnected through equity and social relationships—can report on the CSR actions of non-apex affiliates without providing commensurate substantive actions of their own. Importantly, the control and coordination abilities of these apex firms protect them from greenwashing perceptions. This study, therefore, demonstrates the role of BGs in shaping CSR practices and provides insights for managers to understand the potential risks and benefits of affiliations within BGs. © 2023 The Authors.

       'As multisourcing becomes a widely adopted strategy in dynamic procurement planning, firms inevitably source from suppliers with dependent material flows, and such supply dependence, created by common second-tier suppliers or a common economic environment, is often positive. We show that firms can experience significant profit loss when implementing a policy computed based on a model that ignores the dependence among suppliers’ stochastic material flows. The profit loss is particularly significant when a firm earns a low margin or faces an unreliable and fragmented supplier base. Analysis of the firm’s dynamic multisourcing strategy under dependent supply uncertainties, however, is challenging. By expanding the space of ordering decision to a class of contingency policies, we identify conditions under which the dynamic planning model has a concave transformation. This approach allows us to characterize the optimal procurement policy. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the firm may order more from a less reliable supplier than from a more reliable one who charges the same procurement cost. The order allocation to the less reliable supplier can be even larger when the capacities are more dependent. Though the analysis of our base model is conducted for dependent supply capacities that are independent across periods, we show that the results can be generalized to Markov-modulated supplies or general supply functions that are stochastically linear in midpoint. © 2019 INFORMS',
       'Despite the tremendous number of publications concerned with the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP), inconsistent empirical findings persist and the overall picture remains vague. Drawing on a hybrid theoretical framework (combining the theoretical reasoning of the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) with instrumental stakeholder and slack resources arguments), we address the apparent lack of consensus by meta-analytically integrating the findings of 149 studies. We pay particular attention to two highly material issues: the direction of causality and the multidimensionality of the focal constructs. Meta-analytic results indicate that there is a positive and partially bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP. In addition, our findings suggest that the relationship is stronger when the strategic approach underlying CEP is proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, we reveal moderation effects of methodological artifacts, which may provide explanations for the inconsistency of the results of previous studies. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and outline avenues for further research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',
       'Using an original dataset of 4,183 former J-1 Visa holders from 81 countries—all of whom had worked in the U.S.—I examine how skilled return migrants, as cross-border brokers, transfer knowledge about organizational practices from abroad to their home countries. I hypothesize that returnees’ knowledge transfer success depends on their embeddedness in both their home- and host-country workplaces and develop and test theory about the organizational and cultural conditions that activate or suppress skilled returnees’ ability to broker knowledge across borders. Findings show that not only do host- and home-country embeddedness increase knowledge transfer success, but they also interact positively. At the organizational level, however, the presence of other returnees in a home-country workplace decreases the positive effect of a returnee’s host-country embeddedness, whereas the similarity of a returnee’s industry background to the home-country industry increases it. At the country level, high xenophobia in a given home country diminishes the positive effect of host-country embeddedness but increases the positive effect of home-country embeddedness. These findings inform an interpersonal perspective on knowledge transfer, contributing to work on brokerage, organizational learning, employee mobility, and the globalization of expert knowledge. © The Author(s) 2014.',
       'Management scholarship has grown tremendously over the past 60 years. Most of our paradigms originated from North America in the 1950s to the 1980s, inspired by the empirical phenomena and cultural, philosophical, and research traditions of the time. Here following, we highlight the contextual differences between the East and the West in terms of institutions, philosophies, and cultural values and how they are manifest in contemporary management practices. Inspired by theory development in management studies over time, we offer insights into the conditions facilitating new theories, and how these might apply to emergent theories from the East. We discuss the contributions of the six papers included in this special research forum as exemplars of integrating Eastern concepts and contexts to enrich existing management theories. We highlight the difficulty with testing Eastern constructs as distinct from Western ones by discussing the properties of equivalence, salience, and infusion in constructs. We provide directions for future research and encourage an agentic view to creating new theories and paradigms. © Academy of Management Journal.',
       'While seminal work on dynamic capabilities highlights path-dependent trajectories as an important and distinguishing property, recent studies tend to marginalize this feature in favor of an ahistorical and unbound conceptualization. Following the recent “history turn” in strategy and organization research, we examine the essential yet inadequately understood role of path dependence in dynamic capability building and adaptation. Precisely, we demonstrate that dynamic capabilities, as pattern-based, learned, and context-specific entities, are prone to become path-dependent under the effect of self-reinforcing mechanisms. We further show that in the face of discontinuous environmental shifts, path-dependent dynamic capabilities can—paradoxically enough—turn dysfunctional as they perpetuate current, potentially outdated ways through which a firm reconfigures its resource base. Based on this analysis, we identify ad hoc managerial action as the basis for path transformation and path dissolution, as well as path switching and new path creation, which represent complementary ways to deal with path-dependent dynamic capabilities. Our theorizing extends a contingency perspective on dynamic capabilities by shedding light on the limits and potential alternatives of pattern-based adaptation. © The Author(s) 2022.',
       'Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.',
       'Research on first mover advantages is interested in the performance effects of the order of entry into new markets. However, with a few exceptions, the competitive strategies used by different cohorts of entrants have not been studied. We advance research on first mover advantages by arguing that pioneers and followers differ in terms of the competitive strategy employed. Additionally, our research proposes that the different competitive strategies used evolve over time. To test our hypotheses, we use data from the European mobile industry. Our findings show that pioneers benefit from a hybrid strategy in the initial stages of the market development.

       "This article reviews the literature on Mass Prestige (Masstige) based marketing and analyzes the evolution of the 'masstige strategy' with a focus on how this phenomenon evolved from conventional way of marketing premium brands. We synthesise the findings of prior studies, analyse different dimensions, identify research gaps, call for using existing measures like Masstige Mean Score Scale (MMSS) and develop new measures which would facilitate further research in this niche area as well as help the practitioners in developing marketing strategies for luxury/premium brands. It was found that masstige research hitherto has focused on product-based brands and not taken into account the brands from service sector. This review aims to critically examine the previous studies on masstige marketing and identify potential research opportunities. We propose the Mass-Luxury continuum to place product or service brands in terms of mass prestige. Moreover, we develop ideas for future researchers based on the identified research gaps. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",
       "Prior research shows that increasing the breadth of elements used to create a firm's innovations can improve its ability to successfully introduce innovations. Yet, our understanding of the antecedents of innovation breadth is limited. This study investigates how competition affects product managers' decision to expand the breadth of elements used to create an innovation. I build on the awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) framework to propose that inter-firm competition from rivals' innovations and intra-firm competition from a firm's own innovations both create pressures for product managers to increase innovation breadth, but that the greater awareness and motivation resulting from internal competition will lead managers to increase innovation breadth more in response to intra-firm competition. I find support for these propositions based on a longitudinal examination of mutual fund innovations. This study offers contributions by developing theory about how competition shapes managers' decision to expand the diversity of elements used to develop an innovation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",
       'Managerial studies have long approached socioeconomic settings as “isolated” domains interested in defending themselves from the “external environment”. As a consequence, several managerial models have been developed to address employees and decision makers in protecting ‘internal resources’ as a means to ensure organizations’ suitable long-term survival. Building upon this wide and generally recognized assumption, the paper adopts the interpretative lens provided by a resource-based view and relationship marketing to investigate the influence of employees’ perceptions about internal organizational assets and environmental dynamics on employees’ orientation to knowledge hiding as a way to protect individual knowledge. The perceptions of 525 employees engaged in 21 Italian innovative small and medium enterprises have been analyzed using structural equation modeling. The paper underlines the need to support employees in overcoming an isolation-based view of socioeconomic settings in order to enhance knowledge value through a definition of human-based managerial models and research paths. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.',

       "The strategy field has generally been viewed as somewhat fragmented with the primary 'fault line' stemming from the divide between economic and behavioral approaches. It is argued here that this is a false divide as any but the most trivial problems require a behavioral act of representation prior to invoking a deductive, 'rational' approach. In this sense, all approaches are behavioral. Once we recognize rationality as a process, then the pragmatic question becomes which among the imperfect mechanisms to guide choice and behavior may be more or less preferred. Such a viewpoint not only serves to help span the chasm of behavioral and economic approaches, but it may also connect the applied normative frameworks and approaches within the field to more theoretically grounded approaches. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'Many social problems reflect sets of beliefs and practices-or "institutional logics"- that operate at the societal level and rationalize the marginalization of certain categories of people. Studies have examined the consequences this has for individuals, but have largely overlooked how organizations that address such issues are affected. To understand this, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective. Our approach recognizes that practices within different sectors of a society may be shaped by different organizing principles. However, we suggest practices are also likely to reflect-to varying degrees-broader societal logics. Based on this, we argue that societal logics may work through multiple influence channels and affect organizations in non-obvious ways, depending on how, where, and with what intensity they manifest in society. We test our theory by analyzing how patriarchy, as a societal-level logic, affects outreach to women by microfinance organizations in 115 nations. We find that patriarchy supports practices in the family, religion, professions, and state that suppress this outreach. Yet, in some nations, patriarchy is differently evident across sectors. The resulting contrasts draw attention to women\'s issues, motivate redress efforts, and catalyze resource flows to microfinance organizations. The greatest outreach to women is in these nations. © Academy of Management Journal.',
       'Firms employ various techniques to obtain information about consumer taste/location and valuation prior to making product design decisions. User-generated content has become an important information source. The vast variety and volume of user-generated content makes firms better informed about consumers (precision-improving effect), and the common and public nature of user-generated content makes firms’ information more correlated (correlation-increasing effect). We examine the impact of user-generated content in a setting in which two competing firms that are uncertain about consumer location or valuation design and sell horizontally differentiated products. We find that user-generated content has very different implications for competing firms’ location decisions and quality decisions. When firms are uncertain about consumer taste and choose their product locations, whether firms and/or consumers benefit from the user-generated content depends on which of the two effects dominates. We find that only when the correlation-increasing effect is moderate, a win–win scenario for both firms and consumers occurs, but the society always benefits from user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference strengthens the overall impact of user-generated content. In sharp contrast, when firms face uncertain consumer valuation of quality and choose product quality, they do not benefit from user-generated content, but consumers may benefit or lose from it. When the correlation-increasing effect is significant, both firms and consumers, and therefore the society, are hurt by user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference mitigates the negative impact but amplifies the positive impact of user-generated content in this case. © 2017 INFORMS.',
       'UK Research Councils (UKRCs) spend around £3bn pa supporting R&D and innovation. We provide a comprehensive assessment of these grants on the performance of participating UK firms, using data on all projects funded by UKRCs over the 2004–2016 period and applying a propensity score matching approach. We exploit the richness of the data available in the Gateway to Research database by investigating the heterogeneous effect of these projects across several novel directions which have not been explored before. We find a positive effect on the employment and turnover growth of participating firms, both in the short and in the medium term. Exploring impacts across different types of firms we find stronger performance impacts for firms in R&D intensive industries and for smaller and less productive firms. We also consider how impacts vary depending on the characteristics of the funded research projects in terms of partners characteristics, receipt of other research grants and grant value. Finally, we focus on the different sources of grants, analysing in particular the evolution in the funding strategy of Innovate UK. Our results have implications for the extent and targeting of future Research Council funding both in the UK and elsewhere. © 2019 The Author(s)',
       "Research Summary: Incumbent firms often reposition themselves in response to entrants, but when doing so they incur repositioning costs. Incumbent repositioning costs and the associated decision biases have been identified in the economics, operations, and strategy literatures as critical aspects of the competitive interactions between incumbents and entrants, but they have received limited attention in game-theoretic treatments at the strategy level. To fill this gap, we develop a strategic mental model to analytically characterize the impacts of repositioning costs and decision biases on firms' equilibrium strategies and profits. Including these costs and biases changes, the nature of strategic dynamics as well as introduces new implications for strategic choice. Managerial Summary: Our analysis shows that although biases by themselves are unequivocally harmful for firms, both the entrant and incumbent can earn more when they are biased than when neither one is. In particular, when an entrant is biased in estimating an incumbent's repositioning ability, this unequivocally reduces its own performance, if the incumbent is aware of the entrant's bias and has correctly assessed it. In a similar vein, when an incumbent is biased in its estimation of the entrant, this hurts the incumbent. However, both the entrant and the incumbent can earn more than they would in a setting where both firms are unbiased. Furthermore, the incumbent is not necessarily better off by being less biased—that is, aware of but with an inaccurate assessment of entrant bias. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Rooted in neoclassical economics, network effects research has revolved around size, arguing that the more users a network has, the more valuable that network will be to each user. I argue that a network's structure (feasibility of transactions, centrality of members, structural holes, network ties, the number of roles each member plays) and its conduct (opportunistic behavior, reputation signaling, perceptions of trust) also have significant impacts on a network's value to users and to network providers. Network research that neglects structure and conduct and focuses only on size can lead to wrong strategies or a misleading research agenda. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Firms are facing an increasing pressure to conform to a globally-accepted good governance norm that is largely based on developing economies in order to increase board monitoring. However, many Latin American firms deviate from a set of recommended corporate governance practices by adopting board designs with practices associated with low board monitoring. We attribute this deviation to the interplay of capacity and willingness to bear the high costs of board designs with few barriers to board monitoring. In this study, we use a configurational approach to inductively identify the board designs of publicly listed Brazilian firms. Our findings uncover a typology of board designs corresponding to particular levels of firms’ capacity and willingness to bear the costs of board governance practices that conform to the good governance norm. We discuss our study's implications for strategic corporate governance. © 2023 The Author(s)",
       'Research Summary: Given the high cost of external hiring and uncertainty related to performance benefits, how can organizations foster an environment that maximizes the post-mobility performance of external hires and their collaborators? In this article, I posit that R&D team design is an important factor that could shape the post-mobility performances of both groups. Building on the interfirm mobility, innovation, and teams literatures, I argue that technological knowledge diversity within teams and across teams could differently impact innovation performance. Analyzing 63,976 interfirm moves of engineers and scientists, I find that the post-mobility performances of external hires and teammates are conditioned by team design. A high level of within-team diversity improves the performances of both groups, while a high level of across-team diversity hurts their innovation outcomes. Managerial Summary: In the war for talent, firms often offer premium wages to source external hires. Yet there have been unclear expectations about the post-mobility outcomes of these hires and the implications for team performance. To better assess the value of hiring, managers should look beyond the performance of external hires and also consider team member performance. In the context of knowledge production activities, external hires, on average, experience an improvement in innovation performance after they move. Working with an external hire reduces the productivity of immediate collaborators but leads to more breakthrough innovations with greater technological impact. Most importantly, the performances of external hires and their teammates can be further improved by effectively designing R&D teams. Recomposing teams such that a high level of diversity exists within a team but minimal divergence across teams creates an environment that appears to enhance post-mobility innovation activities. © 2022 The Authors.

       "Research Summary: We study the effect of firm disruptions on competitor performance in the presence of shared resources in the U.S. airline industry. While scholars have investigated both the effects of industry-wide and firm-specific disruptions, little work has examined the effect on competitors, who are increasingly reliant on interconnected resources in the digital age. Results from a series of recent information technology (IT) outages indicate that performance is materially affected by a competitor's disruption. While the disruption of a full-service carrier significantly delays flights of all airlines leveraging its hubs, the exact opposite is observed during the disruption of a low cost carrier. Further, the effect is strongly moderated by the type of airlines reacting to the disruption. Implications for managers and theory are discussed within. Managerial Summary: What happens to my operations when a competitor's operations are disrupted? While research has examined how a disrupted firm can recover, little attention has been paid to competitors, except their ability to exploit the disruption for economic gain. This is problematic, as firms increasingly leverage interconnected resources and infrastructure. We show that an airline's IT outages affect on-time performance of competitors' flights to and from its hub airports. However, the effects depend on both who is disrupted, and who is reacting to that disruption. The disruptions of full-service carriers (FSCs) delay competitors' flights, but that of a low-cost carrier (LCC) leads to early arrivals and departures. Further, LCCs are significantly more nimble reacting to disruptions compared to FSCs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Researchers have long wondered why U.S. firms offer their equity in multiple global capital markets even though they have access to a deep domestic capital market. Based on a propensity score-matching sample of IPOs for U.S. firms from 1990 to 2003, this paper offers some potential answers. We find strong evidence that issuers who choose global equity offerings experience higher valuations at the IPO stage, as measured by Tobin's q. Our evidence also shows that global equity offerings serve as a deliberate strategic tool to increase issuers' international visibility and their propensity to diversify operationally to international markets. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

This comment addresses the insights and potential sources of confusion in the decomposition literature, with a particular focus on Ruefli and Wiggins (2003). We review the basic purpose of descriptive decomposition techniques and argue that they offer no information about the drivers of business performance or the mechanisms by which performance is generated. The techniques in the literature do not rely on ceteris paribus assumptions or a mapping between managerial influence and corporate effects. The estimated effects of industry, business segments, and corporate parents need not be independent to be modeled using variance decomposition. The comment also focuses on the distortions in estimates that can arise when the underlying sample of data does not represent the population accurately. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
       "To foster 'creative destruction, 'entrants must survive the turbulent conditions they face in their first crucial years in the industry. We investigate how the external knowledge milieu of an entrant, conceptualized as its innovative environment, causes systematic variation in survival patterns. We test our model from 3,431 firms in 33 industries over 80 years. We depict the innovative environment along two knowledge-related dimensions, namely technology regime and technology intensity. While the aligned state of the innovative environment, where product innovation exists in tandem with abundant innovation opportunities, promotes entrant survival, we find that this beneficial effect is more pronounced for small entrants due to a possible mitigation of scale disadvantages.

       'Research on International Entrepreneurship recently argues for a fine-grained perspective on different internationalization patterns. By combining prior literature on internationalization patterns with the regionalization hypothesis, we theoretically derive four distinct internationalization patterns of small firms (i.e. born-globals, born-again globals, traditional internationalizers and born-regionals). We then draw on the resource-based view to examine capabilities\' and resources\' impact on these patterns. Testing our theoretical predictions by means of latent class analysis, we find that gradually internationalizing small firms (traditional internationalizers) account for roughly 50% of small firms, while only 15% of the small firms pursue a "true" born-global pattern. International growth orientation and prior international experience promote a born-global and born-regional pattern; learning orientation fosters traditional internationalization; intense network contacts positively affect born-again global patterns and product differentiation leads to a "regionalized" internationalization. We discuss these findings and highlight implications for future studies based on our theoretical and methodological contributions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..',
       'The "firm-specific human capital dilemma"suggests that firms generally want employees to make firm-specific investments but that employees prefer not to make them. We suggest that individual performance may moderate this dilemma such that the dilemma increases as individual performance increases-that is, firms may prefer high performers in firm-specific roles while high performers may resist these roles more than their lower-performing counterparts. We examine our extended firm-specific human capital theory in a context in which the classic firm-specific human capital dilemma likely exists: Business academia. Using a unique data set of 4,164 business school professors from 39 of the top 100 U.S. business schools, we examine how research performance affects propensity to become an associate dean and their compensation increases when taking on these roles. Even though associate dean roles come with a significant pay increase, we find that higher-performing individuals are less likely tobecome associate deans. Surprisingly, we find that lower performers receive higher pay increases when taking on these roles. We conduct exploratory interviews to understand this surprising finding, and discuss implications and opportunities for future research.  © 2021 Academy of Management Journal.',

       'Causal ambiguity describes a lack of understanding of cause-and-effect interactions between resources and competitive advantage. As a central construct in strategic management, causal ambiguity constrains a firm’s ability to replicate valuable capabilities internally, yet, simultaneously, offers a means of protecting those capabilities from imitation by external agents. This analysis shifts the paradigm from looking at casual ambiguity as a given characteristic within organizations and examines the causal ambiguity paradox by looking at how organizations can strategically act on causal ambiguity as a mechanism for extending advantages. Specifically, we suggest actions that deliberately manage causal ambiguity can be a strategic capability and extend competitive advantages. © The Author(s) 2017.',
       'Research Summary: Multinational enterprises (MNEs) invest significant resources in corporate social responsibility (CSR), but their attempts to build a global “social brand” may clash with the execution of operational strategies at a subsidiary level. Using a game-theoretic model, this research addresses the complex interplay of different contingencies that shape the coordination and control challenges facing MNEs when they implement global CSR strategies, including brand spillovers, the risk of public scandals caused by irresponsible behavior, the size of the MNE network, as well as the roles played by nongovernmental organizations and altruistic managers. Challenging the view of CSR as insurance against lapses of responsible conduct, our model shows that investment in social brands helps avoid irresponsible practices across the MNE network, thereby inducing subsidiaries to “walk the talk.”. Managerial Summary: Global social brands are increasingly valuable to multinational enterprises (MNEs), which makes the control and coordination of responsible behavior across their network of foreign subsidiaries a relevant managerial challenge. Indeed, lapses of responsible conduct at the subsidiary level often generate reputational damage at the multinational level. This research explores several mechanisms that help MNEs manage this coordination and control challenge. First, it shows under what conditions MNEs can leverage their investments in social brands to induce responsible practices across their global network. Second, it illustrates how MNEs can exploit collaborations with nongovernmental organizations to reduce the costs of coordinating and controlling their subsidiaries. Finally, it identifies conditions under which MNEs benefit from hiring altruistic managers to run their subsidiaries. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',

       "We develop a model of rhetorical legitimation that specifies the communicative and cognitive structure underlying the maintenance and change of institutions. To do so we draw on Toulmin (1958) and his idea that social actors can use two structurally distinct forms of rhetoric: intrafield rhetoric and interfield rhetoric. We use this distinction to develop and advance novel arguments about the role of rhetoric in legitimation processes. Specifically, we theorize how the use of intrafield and interfield rhetoric shapes and reflects social actors' assumptions of legitimacy at two different levels. We then theorize how the use of intrafield rhetoric relates more to institutional maintenance, whereas the use of interfield rhetoric relates more to institutional change. © Academy of Management Review.",
       "Entrants in new industries pursue distinct technologies in hopes of winning the technology competition and achieving sustainable competitive advantage. We draw on the complementary assets framework to predict entrants' technology choices in an emerging industry. Evidence from the global solar photovoltaic industry supports our arguments that entrants are more likely to choose technologies with higher technical performance and for which key complementary assets are available in the ecosystem. However, diversifying entrants are more likely to trade off superior performance for complementary asset availability whereas start-up entrants are more likely to trade off complementary asset availability for superior performance. This difference is largely due to diversifying entrants with pre-entry capabilities related to the industry. The study offers a novel illustration of how complementarities and competition shape entry strategies. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

       "Investigating career patterns of top managers has been a prominent topic in European Management Journal (EMJ) since the 1990s. Our article contributes to ongoing debates about national differences in top managers' career patterns between European countries. An open question is whether globalisation processes may have challenged the existence of specific career patterns and whether they may have transformed the profiles of business elites in Europe. Our article uses recent data from four European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK), collected in a way similar to an EMJ article published in 2013, with the objective to assess potential developments that have taken place over the last decade. Some of the major changes relate to the growing relevance of business school degrees or certificates (such as MBA degrees), a higher proportion of non-nationals and women on boards, more managers with international experience and an increasing number of top managers with a prior career with auditing or consulting firms. The article provides not only new empirical insights, but also a review of the key characteristics of top managers’ careers, some methodological reflections on cross-national comparison and new research avenues at the cross-roads of career literature and upper echelons literature. By shedding light on the career patterns of key decision-makers in large European firms, the article offers new insights for researchers, educators and managers alike. © 2022 The Authors",
       'Industrial plant closures create a largely unexplored challenge for corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Such plant closures lead to brownfield sites: economic assets and large pieces of land that often cannot be redeployed for alternative purposes, except by incurring significant costs. The direct effects of plant closures typically include a rise in unemployment and value chain disturbance (or dismantling), but brownfields are usually also associated with additional social effects and environmental pollution. Here, a proactive CSR strategy means reducing or mitigating the joint, negative social and environmental footprint of industrial plant closures beyond what is mandated by law (which has tended primarily to address direct effects). We assess the various strategies firms can pursue to mitigate negative, post-closure footprints and we distinguish between two alternative strategic options beyond the ‘legal obligations’ approach, namely the ‘core business related’ (core) CSR approach, and the ‘peripheral CSR’ approach. We explore the case of a plant closure by Bekaert S.A., a large, Belgian industrial firm, which adopted a peripheral CSR approach to manage and redevelop a brownfield site. In this context, we identify four enabling conditions for peripheral CSR to be implemented effectively. © 2021 The Author(s)',

       "This study examines the role of network knowledge resources in influencing firm performance. More specifically: Can a firm that uses the identical supplier network as competitors and purchases similar inputs from the same plants achieve a competitive advantage through that network? In a sample of U.S. automotive suppliers selling to both Toyota and U.S. automakers, we found that greater knowledge sharing on the part of Toyota resulted in a faster rate of learning within the suppliers' manufacturing operations devoted to Toyota. Indeed, from 1990 to 1996 suppliers reduced defects by 50 percent for Toyota vs. only 26 percent for their largest U.S. customer. The quality differences were found to persist within suppliers because the inter-organizational routines and policies at GM, Ford, and Chrysler acted as barriers to knowledge transfers within suppliers' plants. These findings empirically demonstrate that network resources have a significant influence on firm performance. We also show that some firm resources and capabilities are relation-specific and are not easily transferable (redeployabte) to other buyers or networks. This result implies that a firm may be on its production possibility frontier for each customer but the productivity frontier will be different for each customer owing to constraints associated with the customer's network.

       "This paper studies the interplay between two defining features of technology-based firms: licensing as a commercialization strategy and the reliance on equity financing. Within the context of an IPO, we argue that the technology commercialization strategy of a firm going public affects information asymmetries and, therefore, IPO underpricing. In particular, we theorize that underpricing will be higher when a firm's technology commercialization strategy is more based on licenses.

       "We explore the fit between a firm's product portfolio strategy and its governance mode with respect to complementary activities that underlie its product offering. We view firm's governance choice through the lens of orchestrating complementary activities that entail multiple interrelated and often simultaneously occurring transactions. Our key premise is that a broader product portfolio, while offering benefits through the bundle of complementary activities, raises the coordination costs for firms, making integration of complementary activities a preferred mode of governance.We find strong support for our arguments in the context of the U.S. healthcare industry. Hospitals with a narrow service portfolio are more likely to have contracts with physicians as external service providers, and hospitals with a broad service portfolio are more likely to employ their own physicians. Moreover, hospitals that deviate from this fit-based relationship suffer a significant penalty in terms of their financial performance as measured by return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS). Our findings allow us to shed new light on the linkage between strategy and governance mode and enable us to illustrate that performance differences across multiproduct firms may be better understood by considering the fit between their strategy and their governance mode instead of simply focusing either on their strategy or on their governance mode per se. © 2017 INFORMS.",

Using hierarchical linear models for variance decomposition, we find that the role of industry-related factors varies considerably when different measures of firm performance are analyzed and that it is smaller than the share of total variance explained by firm-specific factors. The estimations also allow exploring the role of intangible assets in profitability, revealing that intangible assets play a prominent role among the firm-specific drivers of performance. The evidence confirms the resilience of intangible assets as drivers of competitive advantage in an emerging environment. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.',
       'Research on responsible innovation (RI) is essential and effective for developed countries to achieve sustainable development goals; however, RI is still relatively undiscussed in the emerging Asia–Pacific markets. With the rapid development of big data-related technologies and their application, digital platforms have become a dominant organisational form in the current industrial practice; SMEs have had to conduct digital transformation and realise value creation by embedding the platform ecosystem. However, this has given rise to irresponsible innovation practices. Few studies have investigated the implementation or realisation of RI in emerging market platforms. As the core of RI for the SMEs embedded in the platform is the ecosystem view, which contemplates multiple actors engaging in value co-creation, different from a single actor in existing studies, the sustainable development performance of SMEs is one of the best evidence of the overall RI realisation of the whole platform ecosystem. On the basis of these discussions, we construct a core theoretical model and combine it with existing literature and theories, mainly with RI, dynamic capabilities theory, and neo-institutional theory. We empirically analyse 268 Chinese SMEs embedded in the platform. The results reveal that the data-driven dynamic capabilities of SMEs can become the key driving force in improving their sustainable development performance, thus guiding the platform enterprises’ RI quality. In addition, digital regulatory pressure and digital customer pressure exert a significant positive moderating effect on the association between RI quality and sustainable development performance, which may be closely related to the infantile stage of SMEs’ digital transformation in emerging Asia–Pacific markets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',
       'Formal hierarchical differentiation is a cornerstone of the organizing process. Prior research has focused primarily on pyramid-shaped formal hierarchies, despite documented limitations of the pyramid structure. We adopt a multi-method approach to consider the utility of alternative hierarchical shapes. First, we identify six “pure type” formal hierarchies that teams might employ. Next, we develop three propositions explaining the effects of hierarchy on team members’ cognition and behavior. We use the propositions to parameterize an agent-based computational model in which formal hierarchical differentiation influences team performance by creating power imbalances that affect team members’ perspective-taking motivation, and by influencing members’ social identification with the team. The modeling results reveal how the effects of the six hierarchies are contingent upon task characteristics that influence team members’ perspective-taking accuracy (e.g., task variety), and enable us to craft an expanded, team-level theory of the association between formal hierarchical differentiation and team performance. A field study of 68 clinical nursing shifts in five mid-sized hospitals supports a key theoretical prediction. Specifically, we find that a negatively skewed (inverse pyramid–shaped) formal hierarchy enhances team performance relatively to a positively skewed (pyramid-shaped) hierarchy when task variety is high, but not when task variety is low. © Academy of Management Journal.',
       "Although the retail sector already has a much larger presence of female executives than other industry sectors, it remains unclear whether female executives should be endowed with more power to be effective leaders in the top management team (TMT) of a retail organization. Drawing on the TMT structural power perspective, we argue that structural power of female executives (SPFE) is crucial to improve a retailer's operating performance measured by profitability. We find that SPFE is indeed positively associated with retailer profitability. Further, drawing on the contingent resource-based view, we hypothesize and find that comparable store sales and industry munificence positively, while inventory turnover negatively, moderate the relationship between SPFE and retailer profitability. Taken together, our research has important implications for public retailers to manage their TMT composition and power allocation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
       'Rapid improvements in the precision of mobile technologies now make it possible for advertisers to go beyond real-time static location and contextual information on consumers. In this paper we propose a novel “trajectory-based” targeting strategy for mobile recommendation that leverages detailed information on consumers’ physical-movement trajectories using fine-grained behavioral information from different mobility dimensions. To analyze the effectiveness of this new strategy, we designed a large-scale randomized field experiment in a large shopping mall that involved 83,370 unique user responses for a 14-day period in June 2014. We found that trajectory-based mobile targeting can, as compared with other baselines, lead to higher redemption probability, faster redemption behavior, and higher transaction amounts. It can also facilitate higher revenues for the focal store as well as the overall shopping mall. Moreover, the effect of trajectory-based targeting comes not only from improvements in the efficiency of customers’ current shopping processes but also from its ability to nudge customers toward changing their future shopping patterns and, thereby, generate additional revenues. Finally, we found significant heterogeneity in the impact of trajectory-based targeting. It is especially effective in influencing high-income consumers. Interestingly, however, it becomes less effective in boosting the revenues of the shopping mall during the weekends and for those shoppers who like to explore across products categories. Our overall findings suggest that highly targeted mobile promotions can have the inadvertent impact of reducing impulse-purchasing behavior by customers who are in an exploratory shopping stage. On a broader note, our work can be viewed as a first step toward the study of large-scale, fine-grained digital traces of individual physical behavior and how they can be used to predict—and market according to—individuals’ anticipated future behavior. © 2019 INFORMS',
       'Research summary: This study examines whether the stock and bond prices of firms engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR) can benefit from insurance-like effects during occurrences of negative events. Our results suggest that in the face of negative events, engagement in CSR on a continuous, long-term basis provides insurance-like effects on both the stock and bond prices of firms. Nevertheless, the effects are found to quickly disappear following the occurrence of a second, or subsequent, negative event. Although our results clearly indicate that firms need to allocate some of their available resources to long-term strategic CSR activities, managers must also realize that in a crisis communication, they will probably be able to use their CSR claims on one occasion only. Managerial summary: The purpose of this article is to examine whether firms engaging in corporate social responsibility (CSR) can benefit from insurance-like effects during occurrences of negative events. We find that on the occurrence of a negative event, long-term CSR engagement does have insurance-like effects. We also find that these insurance-like effects may quickly disappear following the occurrence of a second negative event. Managers of firms with a long history of CSR activities need to realize that in a crisis communication, they can probably use their claims of adherence to CSR only once.

       'The communities of research and practice are embedded in different knowledge systems; research favors rigor, while practice favors relevance. Many management scholars have concluded that cocreating knowledge with these two knowledge systems is difficult and rare, with such criticisms or reservations often being based on an event-based account of cocreation in which the cocreation activities occur over a distinct period of time with a clear beginning and end. However, event-based accounts bring the challenges of cocreation into focus. In the present research, we have assumed a process ontology, which brings the dynamics into focus and recognizes that cocreation is continuous. We observed two projects in which researchers and managers collaborated to generate knowledge related to business sustainability, and conducted 67 interviews with 47 participants in similar projects. We found that, by making the process explicit, participants were better able to cocreate knowledge. Furthermore, we identified two devices that helped to make the process explicit: (1) making temporal connections between events and (2) recognizing the incompleteness of the objects. Our study contributes to prior research on cocreation by showing that cocreation occurs not just within events but also between events, so that rigor and relevance are imbricated over time. © Academy of Management, all rights reserved.',
       "Using a 199-day ethnography of Cambridge's 2007 season preparations for the annual University Boat Race, we explore the microprocesses through which highly institutionalized practices are maintained by examining how institutional inhabitants collectively restore breakdowns in institutionalized practice. Our analysis reveals how institutions can be inoculated against such breakdowns through maintenance work. We find that the salience and importance of different forms of maintenance work vary with the nature and process history of practice breakdowns. This lends institutions the plasticity through which ever-changing practice performances can be accommodated without necessarily effecting permanent structural change. © 2013 Academy of Management Journal.",
       'In this paper we use simulations to examine how endogeneity biases the results reported by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. In addition, we examine how instrumental variable techniques help to alleviate such bias. Our results demonstrate severe bias even at low levels of endogeneity. Our results also illustrate how instrumental variables produce unbiased coefficient estimates, but instrumental variables are associated with extremely low levels of statistical power. Finally, our simulations highlight how stronger instruments improve statistical power and that endogenous instruments can report results that are inferior to those reported by OLS regression. Based on our results, we provide a series of recommendations for scholars dealing with endogeneity. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
       'One key objective of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities is the enhancement of relationships with stakeholders such as consumers. However, in order for firms to enhance stakeholder relationships, individuals must be made aware of firms\' CSR activities. As a result, firms dedicate considerable resources to CSR-related advertisements. The current research proposes that, during recessionary periods, managers alter their CSR communications in response to perceived consumer retrenchment to purchase criteria such as price and quality. Using sensemaking as a framework, we predict that managers used cues from consumers during the recent recession, to alter their CSR communications strategies accordingly. We test our hypotheses through a content analysis of over 4000 print advertisements from 2006 to 2010. Our findings demonstrate that instead of lower levels of CSR communications during the recession, the odds of an advertisement containing CSR messages actually increased during the recession. However, the content of this advertising did change in concert with the sensemaking hypotheses. Specifically, during periods of economic decline, CSR messages were more likely to be integrated into "mainstream" advertising. We also find that the use of self-oriented appeals (e.g., cost savings due to energy efficiency) sharply increased during the period of economic decline. We highlight how managers can use these findings to increase the probability that CSR communications will deliver the expected relational benefits with consumers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',
       'Why would some firms persist with continued operations when facing unfavorable economic conditions? Although prior studies have investigated the roles of uncertainty and sunk costs as sources of inertia, an unacknowledged type of sunk cost associated with temporary suspensions of operations is related to the erosion of existing capabilities. Building on the resource-based view and real options theory, we argue that resource idling contributes to capability erosion and that the anticipated capability loss motivates firms to refrain from idling their resources under demand uncertainty in the first place. The negative effects of uncertainty on resource idling are likely to be particularly strong for firms with superior capabilities and for those having a greater reliance on human capital. Using data on oil drilling contractors in Texas, the empirical evidence lends support to our theoretical arguments. Our insights suggest that resource idling shapes the development path of capabilities and risks jeopardizing firms’ competitive advantages. The seemingly operational decision of temporarily idling resources can therefore be quite strategic for a firm, and “hysteresis,” or inertia in continuing operations, can preserve firms’ capabilities.

       "Workplace humor is ubiquitous, yet scholars know little about how it affects employees' behaviors in organizations. We draw on an emerging psychological theory of humor- benign violation theory-to suggest that a leader's sense of humor often conveys counternormative social information in organizations. We integrate this theory with social information processing theory to develop hypotheses about the effects of a leader's sense of humor on follower behavior. We suggest that although a leader's sense of humor is positively associated with leader2member exchange and ultimately work engagement, it can also signal to followers the acceptability of norm violation at work. These perceptions in turn are positively associated with followers' deviance. Furthermore, we propose that these indirect effects are moderated by leader aggressive humor. Data from two three-wave field studies in China and the United States provide support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our results suggest that a leader's sense of humor can be a mixed blessing and elicit unforeseen negative behaviors from their followers. © Academy of Management Journal.",
       "It is popular nowadays for entrepreneurial firms to advance their entrepreneurship outside their boundaries through alliances. This paper studies how the financing of entrepreneurship changes in strategic alliances. We model a financially constrained entrepreneur and a deep-pocket incumbent developing an innovative product through a strategic alliance, which generates externalities on the incumbent. We find that i) in contrast to traditional theories, the entrepreneur's financial constraint can be tightened by an increase in his endowment; ii) an outside investor is introduced as a third party to deal with the free-riding agency problem; and iii) the externalities have a significant effect on the design of financial claims in the alliance contract, and the incentive-compatible financial instruments are consistent with empirical observations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",
       "Research summary: We use a sample of Singapore firms to replicate Barkema and Vermeulen's (1998) study of international expansion through start-ups or acquisitions by Dutch firms. We discover that the authors misinterpreted the regression coefficients for hypothesis testing and only two of their four hypotheses were actually tested. For these two hypotheses, one is not supported in either their study or ours, while the other is supported in their study but not ours. For the remaining two hypotheses we find support for one of them, which is concerned with the curvilinear effect of product diversity on the mode of expansion. In sum, the original study claims that all four hypotheses are supported, whereas only one is supported in the replication. More specifically, the former results, including the effects of the independent and control variables, are largely not generalizable to the latter. Managerial summary: Barkema and Vermeulen's (1998) study investigates the international expansion by Dutch firms during the period from 1966 to 1994. Their results indicate that whether a firm expands through setting up a greenfield operation or acquiring an existing operation is affected by the diversity of the firm's product lines, the diversity of the countries to which it has expanded, and how far the expansion is related to its existing business. We replicate their study using a sample of Singapore firms for the period from 1980 to 2000. Our results show only an effect of a firm's product diversity on its mode of international expansion. Our study clearly indicates the risk of drawing managerial implications from the results of a single study. More replication studies are needed for establishing a solid theoretical foundation to inform management decisions. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'Using an inductive theory-development study, a field experiment, and a longitudinal field test, we examine early-stage entrepreneurial investment decision making under conditions of extreme uncertainty. Building on existing literature on decision making and risk in organizations, intuition, and theories of entrepreneurial financing, we test the effectiveness of angel investors’ criteria for making investment decisions. We found that angel investors’ decisions have several characteristics that have not been adequately captured in existing theory: angel investors have clear objectives—risking small stakes to find extraordinarily profitable investments, fully expecting to lose their entire investment in most cases—and they rely on a combination of expertise-based intuition and formal analysis in which intuition trumps analysis, contrary to reports in other investment contexts. We also found that their reported emphasis on assessments of the entrepreneur accurately predicts extraordinarily profitable venture success four years later. We develop this theory by examining situations in which uncertainty is so extreme that it qualifies as unknowable, using the term “gut feel” to describe their dynamic emotion-cognitions in which they blend analysis and intuition in ways that do not impair intuitive processes and that effectively predict extraordinarily profitable investments. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.',
       'In this paper, we build and test theory about the emotional cultures of prototypically masculine organizations. A qualitative study of fire stations in a major metropolitan area revealed that the emotional cultures of firefighting units were defined by two emotions: joviality and companionate love. In addition, emotion suppression, work-family conflict, risk-taking, and health problems emerged as central themes. A multirater survey study of firefighters across multiple units found that cultures characterized by both high joviality and high companionate love were associated with decreased risk-taking behavior outside of work. Additionally, emotion suppressors who experienced high work-family conflict reported more risk-taking behavior outside of work. Suppressors who experienced higher work-family conflict reported more health problems in strong cultures of joviality, but fewer health problems in strong cultures of companionate love. Longitudinal exploratory analyses of objective performance indicators revealed that, although units characterized by strong joviality had better response times, theywere alsomore likely to have auto accidents and property loss than units weak in joviality, with some evidence that companionate lovemight attenuate risky behavior on the job. Our findings contribute to amore nuanced understanding of gender, emotions, and organizational culture. © Academy of Management Journal.',
       "The study investigates how a multinational corporation (MNC) can promote the absorptive capacity of its subsidiaries. The focus is on what drives the MNC subsidiary's ability to absorb marketing strategies that are initiated by the MNC parent, as well as how the subsidiary enacts on this absorptive capacity in order to compete in its focal market. The dual embeddedness of MNC subsidiaries plays a key role in this investigation, as subsidiaries belong to the MNC network and are simultaneously embedded in their host country environment. We argue that subsidiary absorptive capacity is formed as a purposeful response to this dual embeddedness. An analysis of marketing strategy absorptions undertaken by 213 subsidiaries reveals that MNCs can assist their subsidiaries to compete in competitive and dynamic focal markets by forming specific organizational mechanisms that are conducive to the development of subsidiary absorptive capacity. The findings hold important theoretical and practical implications. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.",
       'Professional sports leagues play a major role in our society, but little attention has been given to organizational factors related to league survival. We address this issue by examining the effects of related agglomeration (the extent to which league teams are located near teams from other sports that share the same broad professional sport identity), sport age, market heterogeneity (high variance in the number of teams from other sports in its teams’ cities), and within-sport league competition (high niche overlap) on league mortality. Related agglomeration may lead to intensified competition but may also lead to benefits by producing agglomeration economies and by driving the development of regional identities. We propose that the effects of related agglomeration vary over a focal population’s life cycle. We also argue that leagues with high market heterogeneity have higher chances of failure, particularly under conditions of high competition. We test our ideas using event history analysis to examine mortality in the entire population history of professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada (which are fundamentally different from leagues in other parts of the world) from the first league founding in 1871 until 1997. We find that leagues in young sports whose teams tend to be located in cities with large numbers of other sports (high related agglomeration) suffer from higher mortality rates while leagues that are in more established sports are less likely to fail under these circumstances. Consistent with prior research, leagues are more likely to fail when they experience higher competition (higher niche overlap) with other leagues in their sport, and the effects of competition are exacerbated by high variance in the number of other sports across the leagues’ cities (high market heterogeneity). We end by discussing the implications of our results for more common multi-unit organizational forms such as franchises and by considering promising avenues for future research. © The Author(s) 2018.',

We analyze a sample of 722 funding requests submitted to an American VC firm and evaluate the influence of the form of the submission and content of business planning documents on VC funding decisions. We improve on prior literature by a) using a large sample of known representativeness, b) relating request characteristics to actual VC decisions, and c) developing an inferential logic that takes account of the multiple sources of information to which VCs have access. We find that the presence of planning documents and some information contained therein are weakly associated with VC funding decisions.

       'We examine when and why creative role identity causes entitlement and unethical behaviors, and how this relationship might be reduced. We found that the relationships among creative identity, entitlement, and dishonesty are contingent on the perception of creativity being rare. Four experiments showed that individuals with a creative identity reported higher psychological entitlement and engaged in more unethical behaviors. Additionally, when participants believed that their creativity was rare rather than common, they were more likely to lie for money. Moreover, manipulation of the rarity of creative identity, but not of practical identity, increased psychological entitlement and unethical acts. We tested for the mediating effect of psychological entitlement on dishonesty using both measurement of mediation and experimental causal chain approaches. We further provide evidence from organizations. Responses from a sample of supervisor-subordinate dyads demonstrated that employees reporting strong creative identities who perceived creativity as rare in their work group, rather than common, were rated as engaging in more unethical behaviors by their supervisors. This paper extends prior theory on negative moral consequences of creativity by shedding new light on assumptions regarding the prevalence of creativity and the role psychological entitlement plays. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.',
       'Research Summary: This study addresses a theoretical dilemma regarding how alliance network constraint (reflected by network cohesion) affects a firm’s alliance formation with new partners. Using a network pluralism approach, we separate a firm’s ego alliance network into two activity-based networks—an exploratory network and an exploitative network—based on the primary value chain activity involved in each alliance. We argue that the cohesion of exploratory or exploitative networks has an inverted U-shaped effect on the addition of new partners in the same activity-based network, and a positive effect on the addition of new partners in the other network. Results based on data from the biotechnology industry largely support our predictions with one exception. Our study contributes to both scholarly understanding of network embeddedness and alliance practice. Managerial Summary: The structure of firms’ ongoing alliance networks may have paradoxical implications for their efforts to search for and form alliance with new partners. That is, when a firm’s alliance partners are tightly connected with each other, the cohesive network tends to both encourage and impede the focal firm to add new partners. We resolve this dilemma by showing that when a firm is deeply entrenched in a cohesive alliance network conducting a certain type of activities (e.g., R&D activities), it may not easily add new R&D alliance partners. However, it may still be able to escape from the cohesive R&D alliance network by seeking new partners conducting other activities (e.g., manufacturing activities).

       "This paper focuses on a topic that has been largely overlooked in the contemporary marketing literature: the role of the state in shaping markets. While a growing body of research offers alternative perspectives about markets from the neoclassical perspective, it ignores the degree of embeddedness of the state in markets. In view of this theoretical gap, we investigate the market-shaping activities of states in emerging economies. Our context is the creation of a Korean cultural product market in Vietnam. Based on a document analysis of the nation branding projects of Korea and Vietnam, we investigate how these states are involved in shaping Vietnamese markets for Korean cultural products through their international and national activities. The findings reveal that whereas the Korean state is mobilizing and building diplomatic ties to promote the Korea's image in Vietnam through its cultural products, the Vietnamese state profits from these products for its East Asian oriented cultural policy. Three actions are being taken by the Vietnamese state: (1) controlling the distribution of Korean cultural products, (2) framing media producers’ and consumers’ behaviors, and (3) creating a network of collaboration between selected Korean and Vietnamese media producers. Through their nation branding practices, the Vietnamese and Korean states act as institutional entrepreneurs in shaping the Vietnamese market for Korean cultural products. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
       "Research Summary: We introduce to the upper echelons literature a novel, linguistic measure of CEOs' Big Five personality traits that we specifically developed and validated using a sample of CEOs. We then provide a predictive test of the measure by applying it to a sample of more than 3,000 CEOs of S&P 1500 firms to explore the direct and interactive effects of CEOs' Big Five personality traits and firm performance on strategic change. Our validated, unobtrusive measure of CEOs' Big Five traits provides a strong foundation for future theory development on the firm-level effects of CEOs' personality traits. Our specific findings also extend our understanding of how CEO personality influences firm-level change and how both person and situation-based factors interact to jointly influence firm strategy. Managerial Summary: This paper introduces a language-based tool we developed to measure the Big Five personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) of more than 3,000 CEOs of S&P 1500 firms. After describing our process to develop and validate the tool, we test it by examining how CEOs' Big Five traits influence strategic change, both in isolation and in combination with recent firm performance. Our results suggest that CEOs' personality traits have a meaningful impact on strategic change, but that the nature of these effects differs based on their firms' recent performance. Our tool also provides a strong basis for scholars seeking to measure the personality traits of large samples of public-company executives. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'We consider four scenarios that can unfold when organizations either innovate or respond rigidly to organizational decline. Two of the scenarios are downward spirals that threaten an organization with possible death, and two of the scenarios are turnarounds. These scenarios are important because they can determine the fate of an organization-survival or death. We explore the conditions under which each of these scenarios is likely to emerge, developing original theory and specifying propositions about those conditions. In developing this theoretical framework, we distinguish between flexible and inflexible innovations as factors in turnaround success or failure. Our model extends current theory on organizational decline to highlight the feedback effects of the consequences of decline and to explain the circumstances in which particular feedback effects are likely to occur. © Academy of Management Review.',

       "We investigate procurement in a setting in which the buyer is bound by sourcing rules. Sourcing rules may limit the minimum and maximum amounts of business that can be awarded to a single supplier or dictate the minimum number of suppliers who are awarded business, thus necessitating split awards. The buyer announces the splits before the auction, and suppliers bid accordingly. We consider two auction formats: the sealed-bid first-price auction, and a version of the open-bid descending-price auction.We characterize the suppliers' symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy for both formats and find that the two formats yield the same expected buyer's cost.We characterize the cost of multisourcing, showing among other things that it is always costly for the buyer to split its award among more suppliers if the suppliers' costs are regularly distributed, but that doing so can actually reduce the buyer's expected auction payment if the suppliers' costs are not regularly distributed. The results from controlled laboratory experiments, involving human subjects, indicate that expected cost equivalence fails when costs are regularly distributed because suppliers bid more aggressively in the sealed-bid auction. However, for split-award auctions with nonregularly distributed costs, the sealed-bid prices are actually higher than predicted by theory. We explain these mismatches between observations and theory through a behavioral model based on bidders' aversion to anticipated regret. The experimental results indicate that the theory does a good job of predicting the relationship between the buyer's average cost and the award splits, as well as the cost of multisourcing. Importantly, the experiments confirm that when suppliers' costs come from a nonregular distribution, it may be to the buyer's advantage to diversify the supply base more than is strictly necessitated by sourcing rules.  © 2018 INFORMS.",
       'We examine how nationalism influences governance choice in cross-border collaborations. While nationalism has historically been within the purview of political scientists, we demonstrate its relevance to management scholars by theorizing how nationalist attitudes and behaviors among decision-makers might shape strategic decisions about collaborations with foreign partners. Drawing on insights from the social psychology literature, we theorize how two attitudes commonly associated with nationalism, that is, lower levels of trust and an unwillingness to work with foreigners, may increase decision-makers’ concerns about opportunistic behavior and invasiveness in cross-border collaborations. Integrating these insights into two key theories of governance choice—transaction cost economics (TCE) and resource dependence theory (RDT)—we derive two competing effects of nationalism: TCE suggests that a heightened concern about opportunistic behavior will make equity alliances preferable, whereas RDT predicts that a greater sensitivity to invasiveness would prioritize non-equity alliances. Examining 11,469 cross-border collaborations over a 25-year period, we find, in line with the RDT-based prediction, that firms from countries with stronger nationalist sentiments prefer non-equity alliances. We also find that cross-country dissimilarities and prior conflict between the firms’ home countries strengthen this negative association. Our findings advance research on cross-border collaborations by demonstrating why and when nationalism may influence governance mode choice. We also contribute to efforts to establish nationalism, specifically in the form of nationalist sentiments, as an important theoretical concept within the management literature. © The Author(s) 2023.',
       "This paper investigates firm value created by non-equity marketing alliance announcements of Korean listed firms in terms of stock price reactions to the announcements. We find evidence that on the Korean stock market, the announcements of marketing alliances produce significant positive abnormal returns, which reflect an increase in firm value, around the announcement date. This suggests that firm managers need to seek for various marketing alliances not only for an effective competition in competitive business environments but also for enhancement in shareholder wealth. The increase in firm value has inverse relationship with firm's size and growth opportunity. In particular, marketing alliances with firms based in G7-countries create greater firm value than ones with firms based in the home country. Our study provides investors, firm managers, and academics with valuable implications of an importance of marketing alliances for valuation of firms in other Asian countries as well as in Korea. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",
       'Industrial and service firms alike are increasingly adopting digital servitization to achieve service-driven growth and establish a competitive advantage. Firms must develop sufficient capabilities to benefit from digital servitization, which is an underinvestigated topic in the literature. This study contributes to bridging this gap by taking a service-dominant logic (SDL) perspective and focusing on value co-creation capabilities in B2B firms that offer digital service platforms and services based on them. It draws on a multiple-case study design involving leading cases from sectors such as manufacturing, engineering and shipping. The findings identify a set of four value co-creation capabilities: digital literacy, aligning, reflecting and coping. Moreover, this study highlights how these capabilities can facilitate value co-creation in the context of digital servitization initiatives. For managers, the findings provide insights into what characterizes value co-creation capabilities in digital servitization and why, how and when these capabilities are relevant. © 2023',
       "Prior research illustrates that incumbent firms commonly react to a rival's market entry by adjusting their marketing mix elements. Incumbents either adjust only one element – adopting a “focused” strategy – or adjust several elements simultaneously– adopting a “combinative” strategy. While previous studies have extensively investigated the incumbents’ marketing mix reactions to a market entry, no study has explored the defensive response strategy, and its consequences have yet to be empirically examined. Drawing upon signaling theory and using a multi-market dataset in the U.S. airline industry, the authors find that, compared to a combinative strategy, adopting a focused response strategy in response to a rival's entry does shorten the new entrant's exit timing. However, when incumbents possess high resource and capabilities, this performance gap between the two response strategies is reduced. The authors discuss the contributions to the strategy and management literature and provide actionable insights to managers and policymakers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",
       'Organizational resilience is an organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning, despite the presence of adversity. In existing scholarship there is the implicit assumption that organizations experience and respond holistically to acute forms of adversity. We challenge this assumption by theorizing about how adversity can create differential strain, affecting parts of an organization rather than the whole. We argue that relations among those parts fundamentally shape organizational resilience. We develop a theoretical model that maps how the differentiated emergence of strain in focal parts of an organization triggers the movements of adjoining parts to provide or withhold resources necessary for the focal parts to adapt effectively. Drawing on core principles of theories about intergroup relations, we theorize about three specific pathways—integration, disavowal, and reclamation—by which responses of adjoining parts to focal part strain shape organizational resilience. We further theorize about influences on whether and when adjoining parts are likely to select different pathways. The resulting theory reveals how the social processes among parts of organizations influence member responses to adversity and, ultimately, organizational resilience. We conclude by noting the implications for organizational resilience theory, research, and practice. © Academy of Management Review.',

However, such results are based largely on studies conducted in highly-controlled settings where participants were provided with the necessary resources to accomplish their assigned task. In an attempt to extend the boundary conditions of current theoretical predictions, we undertook a field experiment within a base-of-the-pyramid setting where resource scarcity is extremely high. Specifically, we collected data on 44 communities within rural Sri Lanka who were tasked with contributing a portion of their resources to the construction of a school building; 24 were assigned to a competition condition and 20 to a cooperation condition. The results of our field experiment, and subsequent follow-up interviews and focus groups, collectively suggest that competitive goal structures generally lead to higher levels of motivation within a resource scarce environment. However, our results also suggest that cooperative goal structures can be highly motivating when groups are unfamiliar with one another, as cooperating with unfamiliar groups can provide access to valuable and rare knowledge within such settings. © 2016 Academy of Management Journal.',
       'Progress toward understanding human behavior has been hindered by discipline-bound theories, dividing our efforts. Fortunately, these separate endeavors are converging and can be effectively integrated. Focusing on the fundamental features of picoeconomics. expectancy theory, cumulative prospect theory, and need theory, we construct a temporal motivational theory (TMT). TMT appears consistent with the major findings from many other investigations, including psychobiology and behaviorism. The potential implications of TMT are numerous, affecting our understanding on a wide range of topics, including group behavior, job design, stock market behavior, and goal setting. © Academy of Management Review.',
       'Abundant research has documented a gender pay gap; women earn less than men, all else being equal. Against the backdrop of an overall female penalty, we propose that the widespread adoption of diversity goals in organizations creates a female premium for certain women. We integrate the economic principle of supply and demand with theory from the field of strategic human resource management and theorize that individuals perceive high-potential women - who have the abilities needed to reach the upper echelons of organizations, where women remain underrepresented - as more valuable for achieving organizational diversity goals than high-potential men and, in turn, reward them with higher pay. Two field studies (Studies 1 and 3) and two laboratory experiments (Studies 2 and 4) reveal a female premium that is unique to high-potential women (Studies 1 and 2), driven by perceptions that high-potential women have more diversity value than high-potential men (Studies 2 and 4), and larger in contexts where diversity goals are stronger (Studies 3 and 4). Our theory and findings challenge the assumption that the gender pay gap uniformly disadvantages women and offer new insight into why and when the female penalty reverses and becomes a female premium. © Academy of Management Journal.',
       'Performance based contract (PBC) is an innovative advanced service strategy for offering product service solutions. PBC aims at increasing customer value and reducing the costs of operations. However, manufacturers incur unquantifiable “hidden costs” while implementing PBC. This paper uses agency theory and service-dominant logic to build a theoretical framework to study the hidden costs of PBCs. The research uses a multiple exploratory case study approach to unravel the drivers of hidden costs during the design, delivery and adaptation phases of PBC. This paper derives findings from five PBCs from the UK defence industry. The analysis reveals four major hidden cost drivers (supplier relations, contract complexity, customer relations, and cost estimation problems) of PBC. The research refines the theoretical framework by linking the hidden cost drivers, PBC life cycle stages and engagement of the service network partners. It develops a set of propositions for guiding future research and managerial practices. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
       'This paper investigates the effect of foreign ownership on strategic investments in Japanese corporations. Foreign owners are typically portfolio investors who frequently buy and sell shares and hold diversified portfolios of small stakes in many firms. Prior research has presented two conflicting perspectives on the role of such investors: (a) their frequent trading leads to pressure for short-term returns that fosters underinvestment; (b) their active trading fosters appropriate investments. We investigated the relationship between foreign ownership and strategic investments using dynamic panel data analysis of a sample of 146 Japanese manufacturing firms from 1991 to 1997. We found that foreign ownership enhances strategic investments (in R&D and capital intensity) to a greater extent when firms have growth opportunities than when they lack such opportunities. We conclude that foreign ownership fosters appropriate investment. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
       "Drawing upon contingency theory, we analyze the antecedents and performance consequences of chief strategy officer (CSO) presence in top management teams (TMTs). We argue that strategic and structural complexity affects the decision to have a CSO in the TMT and its effect on firm performance. The results of a sample of S&P 500 firms over a five-year period reveal that diversification, acquisition activity, and TMT role interdependence are positively associated with CSO presence. However, we also find that the structural choice to have a CSO in the TMT does not significantly affect a firm's financial performance. This first systematic analysis of CSO presence informs research on CSOs and contributes to the emerging literature on TMT structure. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'This study examines the impact of digital transformation on customer value creation in the context of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) operating in the Made in Italy sectors, with the aim of understanding how dynamic capabilities, as enabling mechanisms, may foster digital transformation. We use multi-case study research on the digital transformation of six Made in Italy SMEs, belonging to the food, fashion, and furniture design industries. The results show that, for the selected SMEs, digital instruments contribute to innovation of their business model, creating new distribution channels and new ways to create and deliver value to customer segments. The results highlight the relevance of sensing and learning capabilities as triggers of digital transformation. In addition to the theoretical contribution to the existing literature on digital transformation and organizational capability, this study provides some managerial implications for digital transformation in SMEs operating in the Made in Italy sectors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
       "Online gambling providers require customers to allow email messages from the provider. This requirement provides gambling marketers an inexpensive and potent medium to encourage frequent gambling, higher bets, and other potentially harmful behaviors that may lead to problem gambling. An online casino was developed in 2000 to collect data on online gamblers' actual gambling behavior after receiving persuasive permission email messages. Data were collected over a 36. day period. One of five permission email messages in an online gambling experiment had a significant and large effect in increasing expected gambler retention by an average 20. days. Increasing the length of play is a primary objective of gambling venue owners who often use CRM programs and permission email marketing to increase revenues. This finding adds knowledge to the possible promotional strategies that extends a gambler's lifetime value with an online betting company, offering a competitive advantage to gambling website operators. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",
       "Current theorising about the contingencies underpinning the effectiveness of university technology transfer has emphasised the importance of organisational support, namely the scale of Technology Transfer Office (TTO) support and the provision of incentives. Empirical results pertaining to the effects of these organisational supports are mixed. More recently, academic research and policy reviews have highlighted the potential significance of the strategic choices made by university managers in contributing to the effectiveness of technology transfer activity. Our research attempts to reconcile these two streams of technology transfer research by drawing on Child's strategic choice theory as an integrating framework. Through operationalising a strategic choice framework and drawing upon data from 115 UK universities (collected through multiple waves of the HE-BCI Survey), this research shows that supporting organisational infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient to account for improved technology transfer effectiveness. Specifically, it highlights the key mediating role of strategic choice, suggesting that it is the alignment between strategic choices made by university managers and the supporting organisational infrastructure that accounts for variations in technology transfer effectiveness. Furthermore, we find the mediation relationship between strategic alignment and technology transfer effectiveness is moderated by the breadth of strategic planning efforts, with those universities that engage a wider number of faculty in strategic planning efforts benefiting most from the alignment between strategic choices and supporting organisational infrastructure. © 2019",
       'Existing scholarship on categories has frequently highlighted how some category members violate codes that others diligently abide by. In this paper, we consider differences in identity across category members, and ask how these relative differences determine their response to a code-violating change. Taking a case where category members are identified as “insiders” and “outsiders,” we argue that insiders’ reaction to a code violation depends upon the extent to which they believe their identity is distinct from the code violator’s, who might be an insider or an outsider. We suggest that it is the presence or absence of an “identity buffer”—i.e., a relative identity advantage—that determines insiders’ reaction. We hypothesize that when a fellow category insider introduces a code violation, the focal insider will be more likely to refrain from the practice. When an outsider introduces the violation, insiders will be more likely to adopt the violation provided they can retain an identity buffer. We posit that when outsiders adopt code-preserving behavior, thus narrowing the identity buffer between insiders and outsiders, it will mitigate insiders’ likelihood of code violation adoption. We find support for our hypotheses using data on the Islamic banking industry in 12 countries (2003–2014). Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.',
       'Taking a labor process approach to organizations in cultural industries, this article compares expressive and routine workers (audio engineers and studio attendants) within a US music-recording organization. I describe a practical control strategy that aims to reproduce the pleasurable feel of expressive work among routine cultural workers. Because this strategy depends upon workers’ aesthetic experiences of technological objects, I term this strategy aesthetic enrollment. Drawing upon theories of aesthetic experience and Callon and Law’s enrollment processes, I theorize this strategy as a form of control. Engineers come to love their ability to express creativity at work and appear captivated by the organization’s aesthetically compelling technical artifacts (music equipment or “gear”). Among rehearsal hall attendants, management provides similar aesthetically appealing, expressive technologies. These objects afford experiences among routine staff that resemble those found in more expressive occupations, providing opportunities for creativity in the context of routine, task-oriented work. This strategy manages the “feel” of work and thus incorporates employees by way of their relationship with technical artifacts – part of the organization’s aesthetic landscape. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.',
       'We attempt to provide a more nuanced view of the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm financial performance using a competitive-action perspective. We argue that competitive action should be considered as an important contingency that determines the effects of CSR activities on firm financial performance. Using data for 113 publicly listed U.S. firms in the software industry between 2000 and 2005, we found that socially responsible activities (positive CSR) enhance firm financial performance when the firm’s competitive-action level is high, whereas socially irresponsible activities (negative CSR) actually improve firm financial performance when the competitive-action level is low. By introducing competitive action as an important contingency, this study contributes to the literature on CSR and strategic management. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.',
       "Technology-based ventures face considerable challenges when attempting to raise early-stage capital during the early-stages of development. To create an operational business they need access to financial capital, but external investors prefer to see an operational business before investing capital. This study extends arguments grounded in dynamic managerial capabilities theory to examine the extent to which various trade-offs among the quality of a venture's management team, radicalness of the firm's technological resources, and demand uncertainty in focal markets impact the ability of ventures to resolve these capitalization challenges. We find that higher levels of demand uncertainty and more radical innovations do not appear to enhance the impact of strong management teams on the raising of early-stage capital. However, lower levels of uncertainty do appear to strengthen the effects of strong management teams. Implications of these findings for dynamic capabilities theory and early-stage capitalization processes are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",
       'As research begins to accumulate on employee volunteering, it appears that this behavior is largely beneficial to employee performance and commitment. It is less clear, however, how employee volunteering is perceived by others in the workplace. Do colleagues award volunteering "credit" (e.g., associating it with being concerned about others) or do they "stigmatize" it (e.g., associating it with being distracted from work)? Moreover, do those evaluations predict how colleagues actually treat employees who volunteer more often? Adopting a reputation perspective, we draw from theories of person perception and attribution to explore these research questions. The results of a field study reveal that colleagues gave credit to employee volunteering when they attributed it to intrinsic reasons and stigmatized employee volunteering when they attributed it to impression management reasons. Ultimately, through the awarded credits, volunteering was rewarded by supervisors (with the allocation of more resources) and coworkers (with the provision of more helping behavior) when it was attributed to intrinsic motives-a relationship that was amplified when stigmas were low and mitigated when stigmas were high. The results of a laboratory experiment further confirmed that volunteering was both credited and stigmatized, distinguishing it from citizenship behavior, which was credited but not stigmatized. © Academy of Management Journal.',
       'Organizational leaders are increasingly turning to design approaches as a panacea for uncertainty and disruption. However, frictions between design and typical engineering and management practices make integrating design into organizations difficult. To do this well, it is necessary to foster the coevolution of two types of design capabilities: deep expertise in design practices and wide understanding, application, and scaffolds of design. Underestimating the coevolution leads to three typical “pitfalls” that can limit the effectiveness of investments in design. This article examines each of these tensions in the context of large technology companies and presents practical recommendations on how to avoid them. © The Regents of the University of California 2020.',
       'Social activists sometimes engage in a form of workplace activism that involves using their employer organization as an unofficial platform to communicate social issue messages to external stakeholders. This type of activism follows a different logic from that of more-familiar citizen activism, in which citizens directly target society and its institutions, and that of organizational-change activism, in which employees aim to influence their employer organization. This article develops and tests theory to understand this phenomenon of organization-as-platform activism, using the National Football League “Take a Knee” employee athlete protests as an empirical context. Drawing on past research on social movements and employee activism, we offer a theoretical comparison of these three forms of activism—citizen, organizational-change, and organization-as-platform—to conceptually distinguish them and to theorize factors that uniquely predict the occurrence of platform activism. We find evidence of predictors associated with the attributes of the organizational platform and those of the intended stakeholder audience. Organization-as-platform activism is associated with the accessibility and openness of the organizational platform for messaging use, the visibility of the organizational platform for message transmission, and the receptivity of the targeted stakeholder audience. As employees increasingly bring their non-work identities and beliefs into the workplace, our findings invite new research on the outcomes of platform activism for organizations, the implications of such activism for organizational stakeholder strategy, and the relation between platform activism and employee prosocial voice. © The Author(s) 2023.',
       'We present a case study of an increase in design right filings and concurrent design right litigations in an industry that previously had little experience of design right protection. The motives for and outcomes of filing, and how these changed over time are discussed. We go on to explore the events, which offered the decision makers opportunities to update their beliefs about the scope of design right protection. We find that filing motives changed from specific protection goals to freedom to operate over time. We also find that the actors faced several, but sometimes contradictory, learning opportunities. There are two types of learning relating to the usage of design rights: 1) learning the initial scope of protection and 2) learning the dynamism of scope that results from the growing number of designs in the product category. The evidence suggests that the scope of existing design rights is negatively affected by new design right grants. Our findings highlight the essential role of belief formation and updating in innovation activity and intellectual property rights-based competition. We conclude that uncertain design rights and information asymmetries may have fostered entrepreneurial optimism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.',
       'As the planet warms, storms and floods are becoming wilder-killing thousands, disrupting supply chains and power grids, and causing billions of dollars in damage. Meanwhile, supplies of all kinds of resources are dwindling, and demand is rising. These two megachallenges-extreme weather and resource scarcity-could have an unprecedented impact on corporate profits and global prosperity, warns Winston. To manage these threats, companies must do what he calls "the big pivot." The big pivot represents a radical change in strategy, operations, and mind-set. Instead of focusing first on short-term earnings and treating environmental challenges as niche issues, firms must prioritize tackling the world\'s big problems and use the tools of capitalism to do so profitably. That means taking new approaches to vision, valuation, and collaboration: Companies must set long-term goals based on science and pursue innovations that seem heretical (dyes that don\'t need water, say, or services that replace products). They\'ll need new ROI tools that factor in unpriced costs and benefits. And they\'ll have to work with other organizations, including competitors, to reduce resource dependency (for instance, sharing methods for reducing energy use). By making these moves, firms will increase their resilience to volatile resource prices, electrical outages, and shifts in customer needs. They will improve business performance while advancing the common good. © 2014 Harvard Business School Publishing. All rights reserved.',
       "A firm's internal and external stakeholders may have conflicting demands on the firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) investments. Based on the organizational justice perspective, this study examined the impact of the gap between external and internal CSR investments on firm performance. A panel sample of 3,302 firms and 21,031 firm-year observations from China over the 2010–2019 period was employed. The results empirically supported the negative impacts of the CSR gap on financial and operational performance. In addition, this study found that CSR disclosure strengthened the negative impacts, while the Employee Stock Ownership Plan weakened the impacts. This research also provided empirical evidence of the link between CSR and firm performance by considering the competing relationship between internal and external CSR investments and employees’ perceptions. The findings suggested that managers adopt a more productive CSR strategy based on a careful consideration of different CSR dimensions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
       'In the digitalization era, business model innovation (BMI) has become the critical keystone for platforms to gain a sustainable competitive advantage in turbulent environments. However, platform BMI is currently not clearly understood. Through a longitudinal case study of a Chinese financial service platform, this paper integratively addresses issues related to platform BMI in terms of drivers, change process, and value co-creation dynamics based on the “driver-process-result” perspective. The findings indicate that platform BMI type experiences a change process from Focus BMI to Complex BMI at different development stages. At different stages, platform BMI is highly interconnected because of the continuous accumulation and utilization of digital resources. The two drivers, external pressure and management cognition, act as trigger and filter, respectively, in the process of platform BMI. These results also suggest that platforms have successively formed three different value co-creation models in the BMI process. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.',
       'Web-based firms often rely on cloud-based computational resources to serve customers, but the number of customers they will serve is rarely known at the time of product launch. A recent innovation in cloud computing, known as autoscaling, allows companies to automatically scale their computational load up or down to match customer demand. We build a game theory model to examine how autoscaling will a ect firms’ decisions to enter a new market and the resulting equilibrium prices, profitability, and consumer surplus. The model produces novel results depending on the likelihood of a firm’s success in the new market, di erentiation among potential entrants, and the cost of computational capacity. For instance, in contrast to previous capacity commitment models with demand certainty, we show that autoscaling can mitigate price competition if the likelihood of a firm’s success in the market is moderate and the cost of capacity is su ciently low. This is because without autoscaling, the firms’ uncertainty about demand would lead to excessive computational capacities and thus aggressive price competition. We also find that when the likelihood of success is su ciently high, autoscaling facilitates entry for one firm yet deters a second firm from simultaneously entering the market. © 2018 INFORMS.',
       'Studies focus on the process of business model innovation as performed by start-up firms, while incumbent industrial firms’ attempts to innovate their business models often fail, being hindered by path-dependency. There is a lack of understanding of what in a business model of such firms is modified to produce an innovation that gives rise to value creation. Based on explorations of twenty-two incumbent industrial firms, five dimensions of a business model are identified that, when modified, may result in business model innovation by incumbents. These dimensions are exchangeable, activity, actor, transaction mechanism, and governance setup. The results show how business model innovation can be systemically characterized in terms of several dimensions that must be modified in concert to produce an innovative business model. The results also show that such business model innovations require novel uses of digital technologies that enable new activities to be incorporated into existing business models. © 2022 The Author(s)',
       'The well-known economic theory predicts that consumer price will fall after a horizontal merger when the amount of marginal cost reduction from operating synergies exceeds the premerger markup of a merging firm. However, when a horizontal merger occurs in a multitier decentralized supply chain where a finite number of firms compete at each tier, we show that this result holds only when a merger occurs at the tier that acts as the leader in the supply chain. In this supply chain, a horizontal merger at any other tier will decrease consumer price when the cost reduction exceeds a certain threshold that is larger than the premerger markup. Moreover, this threshold is increasing as the supply chain gets longer and can be substantially larger than the premerger markup. When accounting for subsequent entry after a merger in long-run equilibrium, contrary to a common belief, a larger synergy from a merger does not necessarily benefit consumers more. © 2014 INFORMS.',

       "Research summary: Strategic alliances have been recognized as a means for firms to learn their partners' proprietary knowledge; such alliances are also valuable opportunities for partner firms to learn tacit organizational routines from their counterparts. We consider how relatively novice technology firms can learn intraorganizational collaborative routines from more experienced alliance partners and then deploy them independently for their own innovative pursuits. We examine the alliance relationships between Eli Lilly & Co. (Lilly), a recognized expert in collaborative innovation, and 55 small biotech partner firms. Using three levels of analysis (firm, patent, and inventor dyad), we find that greater social interaction between the partner firm and Lilly subsequently increases internal collaboration among the partner firm's inventors. Managerial summary: Can collaborating externally advance internal collaboration? Yes. Our research found that collaboration among scientists at small, early-stage biotechnology firms significantly increased after these firms formed highly interactive R&D alliances with a large pharmaceutical company known for its expertise in such collaboration. It is well known that alliances help new firms learn specific new technologies and commercialize innovations. Our study broadens the scope of potential benefits of alliances. New firms can also learn collaboration techniques, deploying them internally to enhance their own abilities in collaborative innovation. Managers should take this additional benefit into consideration in developing their alliance strategies. Pursuing alliance partners with expertise in collaboration and keeping a high level of mutual interactions with partner firm personnel should be important considerations to extract this value.

       'This paper aims to better understand the dynamic aspects of strategic alliances between competitors, by relying on both the real options approach and the system dynamics approach. It raises the following question: what are the behavioral dynamics of real options in alliances? The systemic qualitative model we built from the study of an alliance formed by two competing firms around an R&D project revealed three sets of feedback structures (the "expected flexibility", "uncertainty" and "collaborative skills and knowledge" dynamics), in which are embedded three types of real growth options (that is, unexpected discovery, relational reputation and interactive options). While previous studies have often focused on how partners unilaterally manage real options to reduce uncertainty, our study allowed us to identify the real options created by the alliance, which can be exploited collectively, independently by each partner or not at all, and to capture their dynamic aspects. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.',

In contrast with Traditional IT services and cloud-based Digital Exploitation services, Digital Exploration services involve conceiving and implementing new business strategies and processes using new digital technologies (e.g., blockchain, augmented reality, deep learning, IoT). In a follow-on study involving depth interviews with IT customers, the research identifies several factors critical to successful Digital Exploration. These include customer selectivity, close collaboration between IT providers and customers, strategic and systemic thinking, an open innovation approach, and use of performance directionality (versus precise KPIs). In addition, the depth interviews help identify specific changes needed in the mindsets and behaviors of business unit leaders and various functions in IT providers and customers for the promise of Digital Exploration services to be realized. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',
       'This paper investigates how human capital affects trademark applications at the firm level. We adopt a difference-in-differences strategy to examine the impact of human capital on trademark applications, taking advantage of a unique natural experiment in China that expanded higher education enrollment substantially in 1999. We find firms in industries with higher human capital intensities filed for more trademarks after 2003 than they did in prior years. We then investigate the mechanism through which human capital enhancement causes more trademark applications. We find that firms in industries with higher human capital intensities tend to invest more in R&D and worker training programs. We next find that firms that spend more on R&D and training programs tend to develop more new products. We also find firms that have more new products file for more trademark applications. The main policy implication of our empirical results is that encouraging human capital enhancement can generate more innovative products and trademarks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.',
       'We examine the relationship between brand capital and stock price crash risk. Crash risk, defined as the negative skewness in the distribution of returns for individual stocks, captures asymmetry in risk, and has important implications for investment choices and risk management. Using a sample of 39,685 publicly listed U.S. firm-year observations covering 1975 to 2018, we show that brand capital is significantly and negatively related to crash risk. We also use an advanced machine learning approach and confirm that brand capital is a strong predictor of future stock price crashes. Our cross-sectional analyses show that this negative relationship is more evident for subsamples with transitory poor earnings performance or persistent good earnings performance, greater corporate tax avoidance, and weak corporate governance structures. The results survive numerous robustness tests, including the use of alternative measures of brand capital, crash risk, and several endogeneity tests. In sum, our findings are consistent with agency theory, suggesting that high levels of brand capital expose firms to investor and customer scrutiny, which reduces managerial opportunistic behavior that may include the accumulation and concealment of negative information.

       "The World Café has been used to develop business and organizational strategies, to enhance safety performance, to support executive education, to foster community development, and for a host of other specific applications. However, is the World Café superior to traditional strategy workshop techniques in terms of increases in participant knowledge and understanding? Up to now there has been no absolute no answer to this question. This study examines and compares how the World Café and Strategy Workshops influence the development of entrepreneurs in the writing of business plans and as a means to model learning behavior. This study also investigates which kinds of leadership styles (transactional leadership or transformational leadership) can simultaneously benefit learning performance. A quasi-experimental design is utilized which includes pre-post tests. 120 participants attending an entrepreneurial program held by the government are observed. The results indicate that the World Café strategy has a significantly higher positive effect on their strategic planning capability than with traditional Strategy Workshops. Second, the leadership style of the focus leader can significantly increase the entrepreneur's strategic planning capability. Finally, in the discussion of World Café, the effects of transactional leadership on the entrepreneur's strategic planning capability is found to be greater than the effects of transformational leadership. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",
       "Having a gatekeeper position in a collaborative network offers firms great potential to gain competitive advantages. However, it is not well understood what kind of collaborations are associated with such a position. Conceptually grounded in social network theory, this study draws on the resource-based view and the relational factors view to investigate which types of collaboration characterize firms that are in a gatekeeper position, which ultimately could improve firm performance in subsequent periods. The empirical analysis utilizes a unique longitudinal data set to examine dynamic network formation. We used a data crawling approach to reconstruct collaboration networks among the 500 largest companies in Germany over nine years and matched these networks with performance data. The results indicate that firms in gatekeeper positions often engage in medium-intensity collaborations and less likely weak-intensity collaborations. Strong-intensity collaborations are not related to the likelihood of being a gatekeeper. Our study further reveals that a firm's knowledge base is an important moderator and that this knowledge base can increase the benefits of having a gatekeeper position in terms of firm performance. © 2021 The Author(s)",
       "This paper draws upon three broad perspectives on the strategic decision-making process in order to develop a more completely specified model of strategic decision effectiveness in a different context, namely Egypt. The key variables in this model consist of three strategic decision-making process dimensions (rationality, intuition, and political behavior); seven moderating variables concerning decision-specific, environmental, and organizational factors; and strategic decision effectiveness as an outcome variable. A two-stage study was conducted in which the first stage provided exploratory insights and the second stage investigated hypotheses on the impact of strategic decision-making process dimensions on strategic decision effectiveness and the moderating role of broader contextual variables. The second-stage study produced three major findings: (1) both rational and political processes appear to have more influence on strategic decision effectiveness than does intuition; (2) strategic decision effectiveness is both process- and context-specific; and (3) certain results support the 'culture-free' argument, while others support the 'culture-specific' argument.

       "The field of paradox studies keeps struggling to put the notion of paradox into the very centre of organizational life and managerial decision-making, with mixed success. We argue that this research ambition can be realized much more effectively by anchoring the field in three interrelated conceptual approaches which build on paradox as the paradigmatic point of departure. These approaches include Spencer Brown's form calculus, Niklas Luhmann's systems and organization theory, and the traditional Indian logical construct of tetralemma. In the proposed argument, paradox constitutes the very identity of organizations as (re-entries of) distinctions drawn in the environment; it is actualized in every act of organizational decision communication, as well as in the process of the continual vanishing and renewal of such acts. In this conception of organizational life, the key challenge is to debunk false distinctions by using tetralemmatization strategies that entail a radical questioning of the problematic observational perspectives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",
       "Counterfeits are available across many marketplaces. In emerging markets, in particular, consumers often observe a mix of counterfeits and authentic products sold by retailers. It is difficult for some consumers to distinguish between the two types of products. From these consumers' perspective, the products can be considered as probabilistic goods, and we term retailers' strategies probabilistic selling of counterfeits. Retailers who sell counterfeits are subject to a penalty by regulation. We develop a game-theoretical model to study this dishonest strategy under regulation. Our model offers the following insights. First, a higher penalty for selling counterfeits can lead to a smaller proportion of authentic products in the market. This finding is driven by a manufacturer's strategic response: knowing that the penalty becomes higher, the manufacturer has greater incentives to raise the wholesale price of its authentic products. From the retailers' point of view, this elevated procurement cost can, in turn, encourage them to lower the probability of their products being authentic. Second, manufacturer profit increases with the penalty, whereas retailer profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare do not, in general, exhibit a monotonic relationship with the penalty.  © 2023 INFORMS.",
       'Outsourcing has been gaining popularity as a standard practice among the mining industries around the globe to meet the competitive challenges. Benefits and the advancements of outsourcing can be only realized considering the short-term as well as long-term concerns associated with such a business decision. The present study proposes an integrated BSC-ANP (balanced scorecard-analytic network process) approach for selection of the best outsourcing strategy (insourcing, outsourcing, and strategic alliance) for operational activities of the coal mining organization in India. Here BSC is applied to understand the impact of outsourcing decision on business performance through its strategic and financial dimensions. Whereas ANP takes into consideration the interaction effect of the BSC indicators, assigns weights, prioritizes them, and determines the best outsourcing alternative. Although there have been plenty of literature that elucidates the advantages of the BSC-ANP approach, application of such concept in mining sector has been rarely considered. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.',

       "The Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offer unique opportunities for organisations to improve their performance, innovativeness and as a result pursue competitive advantages. However, organisations are uncertain how to adopt IoT to exploit its potential. This study explores emerging issues and future horizons in the IoT business model context, identifying factors that influence and hinder organisation's ability to implement IoT. A survey revealed a number of drivers and barriers to IoT implementation. These findings informed the development of the Aspiration, Implementation and Contribution (AIC) business model framework that offers guidance to organisations about how to adopt IoT in order to create value. Findings provide novel theoretical insight into the barriers and drivers influencing the implementation of IoT technologies. The development of the AIC business model will help standardise the realisation of value and implementation of IoT. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",
       'Despite the growing trend of firms adopting innovative business models for internationalization, scholarly attention remains limited. Existing research provides inconclusive findings regarding the link between business model innovation and international performance. Drawing on signaling theory, this study develops and tests a theoretical framework examining the impact of business model innovation on international performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Analyzing a unique sample of Chinese exporting firms, findings reveal a positive relationship between SMEs’ innovative business models and their foreign market performance. Notably, this relationship strengthens amidst significant foreign institutional voids. However, the relationship weakens for firms displaying greater entrepreneurial orientation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.',
       'Recent work in organizational and strategy research increasingly accords centrality to narratives in developing and legitimating future-oriented strategies. Despite this growing interest in the use of strategic narratives for prospective sensemaking and sensegiving, the design of such narratives as persuasive vehicles that shape beliefs about possible futures and firms’ potential roles in them remains undertheorized. We build on Paul Ricœur’s narrative theory to develop a theoretical framework of how firms can employ imaginative thought, in the form of productive and creative imagination, to depict plausible and desirable “possible worlds.” We term these worlds “futurescapes” and theorize how they synthesize heterogenous information through factual and fictive means to project different types of futures that have differential persuasive qualities. We argue that continuous or near futures are likely to be perceived as more plausible, whereas discontinuous or distant futures are likely to be perceived as more desirable by stakeholder audiences. We further draw on Ricœur’s ideas about narrative time to theorize how narratives are used by firms for temporal reorganization that can alter perceptions of plausibility and desirability, thereby increasing the overall persuasiveness of their futurescapes. We illustrate our arguments using narratives created by auto manufacturers in response to the changing landscape of their industry. Our ideas have implications for research on the strategic use of narratives, future-focused strategy making as temporal work, and shaping strategies under uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2021.',
       "Managers and researchers discuss the high potentials of business model innovation (BMI) that may bank upon alliances' value creation potentials. Yet, which circumstances allow best capture value from BMI? This paper's study investigates how firm size and age, the firm's alliance experience, and the alliance duration influence value capture from BMI. BMI has a positive effect on return on equity (ROE), even stronger for firms with greater alliance experience. Besides hypotheses testing, the study delivers insights about configurations of BMI, ROE, firm size and age as well as the firm's previous alliance experience and the alliance duration. FsQCA shows configurations to low, medium, and high ROE. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",
       'Our aim is to unpack contract design capabilities for detailed commercial contracts, to draw out implications for the locus of such capabilities within the firm, and to examine implications for exploiting those capabilities as a potential source of competitive advantage. We argue that developing contract design capabilities involves learning how much and what kinds of detail to include in a contract. We further argue that knowledge about the management of these trade-offs resides differentially in managers, engineers, and lawyers regarding different types of contractual provisions.

       'Organizational innovation and its effects, and the influence on them of technological innovations, have been under-researched. In this paper the specific impacts that technological product and process innovations have on organizational innovation performance are disentangled. Analysis of 9369 organizational innovators drawn from CIS data shows the impact of each type of technological innovation on organizational innovation performance. Technological process innovations strengthen the impact of organizational innovation whereas the introduction of technological product innovations diminishes it. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
       "This study explores the contingencies relating firm experience to product development capabilities, focusing on experience type (breadth versus depth) and timing (prior versus concurrent). Results from empirical tests in the U.S. mutual fund industry offer two primary findings. First, firms increase proficiency at adapting their processes to address new opportunities as they accumulate experience in entering new niches, but face initial hurdles broadening their experience base. Second, concurrent learning is capacity constrained, as product quality increases in the number of products introduced simultaneously in one niche, but quality decreases as the firm's concurrent portfolio of new products broadens. Jointly, these findings highlight that dynamic capabilities are built through prior adaptation experience and that management of a product development portfolio is an important managerial capability.

       'We investigate the effect of a status-enhancing prize on the attention that a recipient’s “neighbors” subsequently receive. Do neighbors—individuals who work in economic, intellectual, or artistic domains that are proximate to prize winners—bask in the reflected glory of the ascendant actor and therefore gain as well? Or does competition for attention ensue, attenuating the recognition neighbors would otherwise have garnered? We study the spillover effects of status shocks using life sciences research articles published from 1984 through 2003. Exploiting expert-assigned article keywords, we identify papers that are topically related to publications of future appointees to the prestigious Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). In difference-in-difference specifications, we find that these scientific neighbor articles experience substantial declines in citation rates after HHMI appointments are announced. That is, neighboring articles attract less attention when authors of papers near them receive a prestigious prize. This pattern reflects more than the trivial transfer of attention from non-winners to winners: once prizes are announced, actors cede scientific territory to prize winners and pursue other opportunities. These negative spillover effects are moderated or even reversed by scientists’ social connections and by the novelty and stature of scientific domains. © The Author(s) 2017.',
       'Research Summary: To prevent loss of control post-IPO, founder-CEOs can implement control-enhancing mechanisms disconnecting ownership from voting rights. However, this decision places them in a rich versus king dilemma. If they choose to implement such mechanisms and secure the king position, they risk losing money at IPO. If they choose not to implement control-enhancing mechanisms and adopt the rich position they risk losing control over the firm. We investigate theoretically and empirically the outcomes of this dilemma in a multi-period setting (at IPO and post-IPO). We found that the majority of founder-CEOs who choose the king option recover initial wealth loss, and hence, they can reconcile the rich and king paths in the long-run post-IPO. Managerial Summary: Founder-CEOs often use control-enhancing mechanisms (CEMs), such dual class shares, pyramid control structures, and pact agreements, to maintain control over their IPO firms. In this study, we investigate the effects of these CEMs on firm value at IPO and post-IPO using a unique hand-collected dataset comprising all founder-CEO led firms that went public on French regulated markets between January 1992 and December 2010. We found that most founder-CEOs who use multiple CEMs leave considerable amounts of money on the table at IPO date but they are able to recover their initial loss 5 years post-IPO. This result suggests that an IPO may constitute a valuable financing alternative even for founder-CEOs who value control. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
       "Director tenure is a topic of great interest in the corporate governance debate. Researchers try to assess the effects of tenure on director contribution, board effectiveness and firm performance. Regulators, corporations, and institutional investors advocate for term limits for outside directors to reduce the risks of impaired governance. Despite the burgeoning interest, there is lack of consensus on the mechanisms shaping directors' contributions over time. We argue that next to the ‘loss of independence’ and ‘knowledge acquisition’ hypotheses, respectively predicting a negative and positive effect of tenure on task performance, socio-cognitive and behavioral approaches elucidate the way in which directors' contributions rise and decline with time. Using a multiple case study approach, we document wide variability in directors' contributions at similar levels of tenure. We find this is due to a series of contingencies including whether directors are novice or experienced, the frequency and nature of board interactions, and the relative power of a director. This variability is particularly clear in longer serving directors for whom we find polarizing results: while some grow stale in the saddle, others sustain high levels of contribution despite extreme tenures. The latter finding is at odds with agency-based assumptions and general predictions from the literature. Overall, our study offers a tentative explanation as to why setting an ‘ideal’ tenure for outside directors has proven so difficult and encourages boards and policy makers to consider the influence of director-level features as well as board dynamics in shaping directors' contributions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
       'Combining primary survey data collected from a probability sample of U.S. advertising agencies and semi-structured interviews with advertising practitioners, I tested a novel link from class background to creative employment through a cultural process of matching people to jobs. Qualitative data show that shared culture, specifically “omnivorous”—diverse and inclusive—taste and socialization, signals creative potential to employers and motivates people to pursue creative positions. Structural equation modeling reveals that omnivorous socialization and taste mediate the relationship between class background and creative employment: when middle-class parents expose their children to diverse leisure activities, this exposure has a positive indirect effect on creative employment. It may not actually make those children more creative, but such exposure makes them more likely to enter fields in which they will be viewed as creative. The findings highlight a new direction for research on creativity, contribute to the debate on the role of cultural capital in occupational attainment, and extend knowledge on the early origins of career choice. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.'];
