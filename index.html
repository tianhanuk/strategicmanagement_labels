The schism has not historically existed in China and the East, where scholarship and practice are by tradition regarded as an integrated whole. This paper seeks to narrow the gulf by exploring the conception of management scholarship in the global context, a concern that goes to the heart of what an academic career in management means today, and how scholars may contribute to research and the profession in general. This paper conveys lessons and insights from my three decades of scholarly work developing competitive dynamics and ambicultural management as distinctive research domains, as well as academic and business ventures I have founded to support my research. All these entrepreneurial undertakings are grounded in an expansive, integrated “Chinese” view of management scholarship. Academics seeking to explore synergies between scholarship and practice and to achieve a balanced career anchored in research may find that my entrepreneurial efforts to integrate scholarly and practical ventures offer a useful guide. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',
 'The canonical approach argues that firms located in industrial districts enjoy advantages for both innovation and performance as a consequence of the exceptionally strong knowledge spillovers that flow freely and spontaneously within them. However, diffusion of shared competences is not as easy and free as postulated in the literature. Using the resource-based view, we study whether clustered firms perform better than non-clustered firms, by providing empirical evidence that location of firms in an industrial district does not directly create innovation capabilities or economic rents. This research question is important because it enables us to better understand how firms benefit from this external knowledge flow, both to create advantages in technological innovation and to obtain superior organizational performance. To stand out in capabilities that are often localized at the centre of the same industrial district, a firm needs to develop a learning internal micro-environment capable of better absorbing localized knowledge spillovers. In particular, the organic form is revealed as a configuration well suited to combining structural flexibility with the productive flexibility offered by the district and to strengthening technological innovation capabilities, thus improving organizational performance. © 2011 The Author(s).

 'We empirically examine the simultaneous relationship between international market scope and political risk in the foreign direct investment (FDI) portfolio of multinational enterprises. We argue that firms can take advantage of their experience interacting with governments in risky locations when entering new markets and benefit from international diversification advantages. At the same time, companies with investments in a larger number of countries can adopt a more risk-tolerating approach and enter riskier locations in subsequent investments where they expect higher returns as a consequence of lower competition and a more efficient leverage of their existing knowledge and routines. We analyze a sample of 164 Spanish firms using a 3SLS simultaneous equation model and show that higher levels of political risk in FDI portfolios lead to broader international market scopes and vice-versa. Our results emphasize the increasing relevance of market-political ambidexterity, the capability of simultaneously managing political and market challenges. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Operating in the home country provides firms with substantial experience and learning opportunities. Emerging market economies provide a rich context in terms of diversity of sub-national institutions, competitors, consumers, and business networks. Operating in such context enables EMNEs to experience and learn about developed and underdeveloped institutions, building relationships with firms within and outside of their networks, customers with diverse income levels, tastes and preferences, and competition from firms with multiple ownership groups. The experience and learning that EMNEs gain from such diversity in their home environments assist them in their international expansion. Focusing on the pre-internationalization stage, we identify different aspects of home country diversity that facilitates EMNE internationalization. Additionally, we discuss the firm-specific contingencies that enable or restrict learning from home environments. © 2020',
 'The field of dynamic capabilities has developed very rapidly over the last ten years. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the concept, and identify two major current debates around the nature of dynamic capabilities and their consequences. We then review recent progress as background to identifying the contributions of the seven papers in this special issue, and discuss the relative merits of qualitative and quantitative studies for investigating dynamic capabilities. We conclude with recommendations for future research arguing for more longitudinal studies which can examine the processes of dynamic abilities over time, and for studies in diverse industries and national contexts. © 2009 British Academy of Management.',
 'Political opportunity structure refers to the specific features of a political system (e.g., a country) that can explain the different action repertoires, organizational forms and impacts of social movements, and social movement organizations in that specific country. With the globalization of environmental problems and solution strategies, important parts of the environmental movement have also become global. To what extent could the concept of international political opportunity structure (IPOS) be useful for analyzing transnational environmentalism in the 21st century? In this article, four of the most important constituent parts of IPOS (United Nations [UN], European Union [EU], World Bank, andWorld Trade Organization [WTO]) and their interactions with environmental movements and environmental movement organizations are analyzed. Whereas the UN and EU provoke the participation of a large number of transnational environmental lobby groups whose impacts, however, remain limited, the World Bank and WTO provoke more unconventional actions with potentially farther reaching impacts. © 2006 Sage Publications.',
 'The world in which today’s businesses operate has become not only riskier but also more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA). Organizations that hew too closely to traditional ways of operating will be hampered in their ability to succeed. In contrast, those that focus on new product and process developments coupled with business model innovation will leverage their dynamic capabilities. An essential overlay is entrepreneurial leadership from top management teams. Strong dynamic capabilities are impossible without it. This article examines how business model innovations, dynamic capabilities, and strategic leadership intertwine to help organizations thrive in VUCA worlds. © The Regents of the University of California 2018.',
 'Although business groups benefit firms when markets fail, does group affiliation continue to be an advantage for firms in deregulated, globally competitive industries? I argue that affiliation allows firms to tap into the knowledge and connections of sister affiliates. This enables them to attract clients from more industries and foreign markets than can unaffiliated firms, and to attain higher international sales. Using data from the Indian software industry, I find support for these hypotheses, but only for 2000-02, when competition increased as a result of new deregulation. These results suggest business groups continue to provide benefits to group-affiliated firms, including information on market opportunities and "reputation signaling" to clients. © Academy of Management Journal.',
 "As product markets mature, firms are increasingly offering industrial services, in order to differentiate themselves and remain competitive. The general strategic view emerging from the services literature is that service infusion in manufacturing industries takes a somewhat unidirectional path from products to service provision. Based on in-depth case study research in the materials handling industry and drawing on Lindblom's (1979) concept of disjointed incrementalism, this study shows how service infusion often takes place in small steps without clearly directed efforts. The study identifies elements of incrementalism central to service infusion and demonstrates how a successful service strategy involves continuous modifications, adaptability, the seizing of ad hoc innovation, a continuous recalibration of opportunities, and the management of intertwining goals. The study introduces the concept of agile incrementalism; this concept aptly describes this contingency approach. The article contributes to a multifaceted and nuanced picture of service strategy and the service-infusion process. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Consumers in Western markets are increasingly critical towards globalization and re-embrace local values. Companies thus must decide whether to continue to pursue global branding strategies and/or rejuvenate local branding strategies. To explore the implications of market globalization for consumer preferences, we use signaling theory to investigate the role of perceived brand globalness (PBG) and brand localness (PBL) as signals of brand credibility, related downstream effects and boundary conditions, across two countries with differing levels of globalization. In globalized markets, PBG is a weaker signal of brand credibility than PBL, whereas in globalizing markets, the two signals are of equal importance. © 2020, Academy of International Business.',
 'This paper empirically investigates the interplay between buyer search behavior and firm pricing strategy in a commodity market where many firms compete in price to sell homogeneous products. We use the heterogeneity in buyer search cost to rationalize why a firm offers periodic price discounts and enjoys a high profit in such a market. An estimation method is proposed to recover the nonparametric distribution of buyer search cost from the price and transaction volume data. With both data, we show that the search cost distribution can be estimated nonparametrically in a sequential search model, and estimation results from a nonsequential search model are robust to the assumption on the maximum number of searches. We also show that the commonly observed high-low pricing strategy can be an optimal strategy for firms when buyers search for price information sequentially. As an empirical application, we use the proposed method to estimate the two search models using data on a commodity product sold by a firm in a business-to-business market. The models predict a high profit margin for the firm, which is consistent with the data, but the sequential search model fits with the observed price distributions and supply costs better than the nonsequential search model. © 2017 INFORMS..',
 'Accredited investors finance more than 75,000 U.S. startups annually. We explain how training aspiring entrepreneurs to pitch their new business ideas to these investors a ects their odds of continued funding discussions. We model accredited investors’ decision to continue investigation as a real option whose value is a function of their experience and the information contained in the entrepreneurs’ pitches. We derive four hypotheses from the model, which we test through a field experiment that randomly assigns pitch training at four elevator pitch competitions. The data support all four hypotheses and are inconsistent with alternative explanations. © 2017 INFORMS.',
 "This paper develops a multidimensional, process-based conceptualization of alliance portfolio management capability. Arguing that such a capability consists of organizational processes to proactively pursue alliance formation opportunities, engage in relational governance, and coordinate knowledge and strategies across the portfolio, we examine the impact of such a capability on organizational outcomes in the context of formal structure (alliance function) and strategy (portfolio diversity). Using data from 235 firms, we find that these three processes have a positive effect on a firm's alliance portfolio capital, and some of these effects are conditioned by a formal alliance function and diversity of the portfolio. Whereas the ability of proactive formation and relational governance processes to create value is further strengthened in the presence of an alliance function, that of the coordination dimension is weakened. Furthermore, the benefits of relational governance are strengthened for firms with diverse portfolios, whereas the benefits of coordination processes are weakened. We discuss implications of these findings for the alliance and network literature, and in general, for firm heterogeneity. In summary, we find evidence that variance in process-based capabilities to manage alliance portfolios can explain performance heterogeneity among firms. © 2009 INFORMS.",
 'We challenge the traditional view that innovations always help exporters prosper in competitive international market, by developing and testing the premise that the relationship between innovation and export performance is contingent on some important firm-specific idiosyncrasies. With a large dataset of Chinese firms, the empirical results demonstrate that innovation could be detrimental to exporter survival. Such negative effect is more pronounced for firms that have weak profitability and high outstanding receivables, and also for those without foreign ownership. Nonetheless, we also observe a positive relationship between innovation and survival in highly profitable exporters. By identifying the negative rather than conventionally assumed positive effect of innovation, and the conditions under which innovation facilitates or impedes exporter survival, this paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between innovation and export in the context of emerging markets. Our findings have important implications for how managers develop innovation strategy to compete in the export market. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.',
 "We examine the post-divestment performance of subsidiaries that have been divested by their foreign owners and have subsequently been acquired by domestic owners. Drawing on Hymer's classic explanation of firm internationalization and on the resource-based view dimension of internalization theory, we suggest that the differences in terms of the degree to which FSAs are independent from the linkages to the parent firm will be reflected in the variation in the performance effect of a foreign-to-domestic sale of the business. We argue that the negative performance effect of a foreign-to-domestic sale of a subsidiary is lower (1) for older subsidiaries, (2) for subsidiaries oriented toward the domestic, and (3) when the foreign parent firm is located outside the subsidiary's geographic region. By using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences estimations, we examine the proposed effects and provide novel insights on the performance implications of the foreign-to-local ownership changes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
 'Servitization research has principally focused on the transition of organizational-level strategy, systems, capabilities, and processes for firms to be able to offer advanced services to their customers. Less is known of the underlying microfoundational dynamics of such transitions at the individual-level. Based on a multiple case study of six large multinational industrial firms engaged in servitization efforts, this paper identifies the tactics (i.e., evangelizing, bootlegging, leveraging, and collaborating) that individuals adopt to overcome organizational resistance to servitization. This study also presents the conditions that are necessary for individual employees to adopt these tactics. The present study provides theoretical and practical implications of the microfoundations of servitization, focusing attention on individual-level actions that affect the outcomes at the organizational-level to drive servitization efforts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Globalization is motivating many emerging market firms (EMFs) to expand operations through outward foreign direct investment (OFDI). General FDI theories, such as internalization theory and the OLI paradigm, are based on industrialized countries, leading to inevitable gaps in explaining the OFDI activities of EMFs. We extend the literature by establishing a connection between international finance and the internationalization of EMFs. We argue that foreign banks operating in emerging markets offer a diverse set of resources that can help EMFs expand globally. Under gradually easing foreign bank entry restrictions in China, utilizing a panel dataset of Chinese listed companies spanning 2001–2018, we find a positive association between foreign bank entry and the OFDI activities of Chinese companies. The identified channels include direct loan support from foreign banks, information support from foreign banks’ global branch networks, a high level of internationalization, and close proximity to local companies, as well as loan support from domestic banks under foreign bank competition. The entry of foreign banks particularly stimulates OFDI in non-state-owned, higher profitability companies, in medium-sized, low financial marketization, and node cities designated in the Belt and Road Initiative. These findings provide new insights into emerging market financial openness and the internationalization of EMFs. © Academy of International Business 2024.',
 'We examine how call-center employees draw on opposed discourses to understand the purpose and consequences of performance measurement as workplace surveillance. Sometimes the workers saw performance measurement as a legitimate and impartial managerial tool serving the interests of everyone in the organization (e.g. by exposing free-riding, etc.). Other times, they saw performance measurement as intrusive and oppressive; imposed on them by managers who, as agents of employers, used it to serve a narrow set of interests (e.g. by intensifying work, etc.). Our analysis depicts how employees used an ironical process of predicate logic to develop flexible meaning-making strategies to cope with the apparent conflicts in meaning that arose from the two opposed discourses. We conclude by developing a three step method for the practical analysis of such ironical situations of competing discourses that facilitates our ability to reconsider and reconfigure meaning in more useful ways. © The Tavistock Institute 2011.',
 'Research Summary: Distinctiveness is an essential element of crafts. Building on optimal distinctiveness theory, we examine the relationship between craft-based ventures, distinctiveness, and crowdfunding performance. Using a sample of 10,915 craft campaigns and 429,290 non-craft campaigns, we find that craft-based campaigns have higher distinctiveness but realize lower success through distinctiveness. Additionally, craft-based campaigns with a higher risk index have lower distinctiveness, those with higher strategy breadth have higher distinctiveness, and those with lower cognitive complexity have higher distinctiveness. The findings have implications for crafts-based entrepreneurs in leveraging distinctiveness and the value of lowering perceptions of distinctiveness through elements of strategic entrepreneurship—strategy breadth and cognitive complexity. Managerial Summary: Our study aids craft-based entrepreneurs in presenting their ventures in crowdfunding contexts. We find that increasing the distinctiveness of craft-based ventures results in lower crowdfunding campaign performance. Additionally, our results indicate that craft-based campaigns that have higher risk have lower levels of distinctiveness. Conversely, we find that craft-based campaigns with higher levels of strategic breadth and lower levels of cognitive complexity exhibit higher levels of distinctiveness. These findings have important implications regarding best practices related to how craft-based entrepreneurs can best present their ventures within crowdfunding contexts. Specifically, our results indicate that craft-based ventures can realize better crowdfunding performance via lower levels of distinctiveness within their campaigns. © 2024 Strategic Management Society.',
 'We examine how chief executive officer (CEO) narcissism influences the interorganizational imitation of corporate strategy. We theorize that narcissistic CEOs are influenced more by the corporate strategies they experienced on other boards and less by the corporate strategies experienced by other directors. These effects are strengthened if the other firms to which the CEO has interlock ties have high status and if the CEO is powerful. Through longitudinal analyses of Fortune 500 companies’ decisions (from 1997 to 2006) related to the acquisition emphasis of a firm’s growth strategy and the firm’s level of international diversification, we show that narcissistic CEOs are influenced by corporate strategies that they witnessed at other firms much more than other CEOs. In addition, relatively narcissistic CEOs not only strongly resist the influence of other directors’ prior experience but also tend to demonstrate their superiority by adopting corporate strategies that are the opposite of what fellow directors’ prior experience would suggest. Our theory and results highlight how CEO narcissism limits directors’ influence over corporate strategy and influences CEOs’ learning and information processing in making strategic decisions. © The Author(s) 2014.',
 'While extant research has welcomed the resource and capability perspectives as valuable lenses to study international business phenomena, there have been scant attempts to study the role of comprehensive sets of firm resources and capabilities on different aspects of export venture performance and even less the role of their interactions. This study examines the impact of experience, scale of operation and financial resources as well as informational, customer relationship and product development capabilities on dimensions of export venture performance. The results suggest an interesting role of knowledge factors. Each one of experience and informational capabilities has a U-shaped effect on export venture performance, while their interaction negatively impacts the same, denoting that the two factors are antagonistic. Scale of operation and financial resources have a U-shaped and a negative effect respectively on adaptability only, while neither customer relationship nor product development capabilities directly influence export venture performance. Finally, the interaction of product development with informational capabilities has a positive impact only on efficiency. Practitioners are offered specific suggestions as to where they should place emphasis when pursuing particular performance objectives. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.',
 "This study attempts to investigate the role of absorptive capacity of emerging market firms in creating shareholder value from developed market acquisitions. It analyzes the cumulative abnormal return of cross border acquisitions of listed Indian firms in Europe focusing on acquirers' research intensity. The study discovers a U-shaped relationship between research intensity of Indian acquirers and their cumulative abnormal return following acquisitions in Europe. As such, firms with no research capacity can benefit from the acquisition by accessing advanced targets, although firms with extensive research capacity outperform any of their Indian competitors as these firms have the absorptive capacity to not only exploit but also explore the knowledge base of the acquired target. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of the acquisition of a high-tech target company, regardless of the absorptive capacity of the acquirer. We also found that business group membership has a positive impact on shareholder value, although horizontal acquisitions as compared to vertical and unrelated deals have a significantly negative impact for these companies. This result is again linked to the more explorative nature of vertical and unrelated acquisitions in comparison with horizontal deals that are more based on the exploitation of existing resources and capabilities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",
 'How can service firms internationalize in the absence of significant resources and capabilities prior to internationalization? This question is important, because internalization theory has dismissed the possibility of internationalization without firm-specific advantages (FSAs) or country-specific advantages (CSAs). This conceptual study argues that resource-scarce service firms undertake FDI to access intangible resources abroad, which are then used to develop FSAs in these firms’ domestic market. We call this novel service internationalization strategy domestic market-seeking internationalization (DMSI). We embed DMSI within a comprehensive internalization theory-based framework that derives testable propositions. The framework extends internalization theory by explaining generic service internationalization strategies through leveraging different types of domestic and foreign-originated FSAs. In addition, this study provides recommendations for practicing managers who face the dilemma of increasing competitive pressures to take their firm international under severe resource constraints, a challenge typical to many emerging economy firms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd',
 'This paper explores how frontline workers contribute to an organization’s realized strategy. Using a workplace studies approach, we analyse the work of museum tour guides as a salient example of workers engaged in frontline work. Our findings demonstrate the subtle and intricate nature of the embodied work of frontline workers as they ‘bring into being’ the strategic aims of an organization. We identified five elements as central to this process: (1) the situated physical context; (2) audience composition; (3) the moral order; (4) the talk, actions and gestures of the guide; and (5) the corresponding talk, actions and gestures of the audience. Drawing on these categories, we find frontline workers to demonstrate ‘interactional competence’: assessing and making use of the physical, spatial and material specifics of the context and those they are interacting with, and enlisting interactional resources to uphold a moral order that brings these others in as a working audience, encouraging them to respond in particular ways. Frontline workers thus skilfully combine language, material and bodily expressions in the flow of their work. Demonstrating these dynamics gives a more central role to material in the realization of strategy than previously recognized; demonstrates that ‘outsiders’ have an important part to play in realizing strategy; and highlights the importance of frontline workers and their skilled work in bringing strategy into being. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.',
 'We study how corporate governance affects firm value through the decision of whether to fire or retain the chief executive officer (CEO). We present a model in which weak governance-which prevents shareholders from controlling the board-protects inferior CEOs from dismissal, while at the same time insulates the board from pressures by biased or uninformed shareholders. Whether stronger governance improves retain/replace decisions depends on which of these effects dominates. We use our theoretical framework to assess the effect of governance on the quality of firing and hiring decisions using data on the CEO dismissals of large U.S. corporations during 1994-2007. Our findings are most consistent with a beneficent effect of weak governance on CEO dismissal decisions, suggesting that insulation from shareholder pressure may allow for better long-term decision making. © 2014 INFORMS.',
 'The international entrepreneurship literature maintains that small- and medium-size firms can suffer from resource constraints as they move abroad. To alleviate this problem, research suggests participating in strategic alliances. We develop and test the theoretical perspective that not all alliances are the same; cooperative agreements with non-competitors and competitors have disparate direct and moderating impacts on international performance. Based on an analysis of 162 British and U.S. private SMEs, our results indicate that alliances with non-competitors are positively associated with international performance, but that alliances with competitors are negatively related. In addition, our findings suggest that in alliances with non-competitors, entrepreneurial orientation helps SMEs increase international performance and that in alliances with competitors, entrepreneurial orientation simply reduces the negative impact. © 2013 Strategic Management Society.',
 "Event studies, which have significantly advanced mergers and acquisitions (M&A) research, obtain excess returns based on a theory linking a firm's shareholder returns to those of the market. For outcomes lacking such a theory, we propose an empirical approach using a synthetic control method with machine learning to link outcomes for the acquirer or target to those for a group of comparison firms. We discuss the method's assumptions, its close parallel to event studies, and its difference in weighting comparison firms (based on data versus derived from theory). We provide an illustration of Dollar Tree's acquisition of Family Dollar, by analyzing shareholder returns (to demonstrate consistent results with an event study), realized cost and sales synergies, and customer sentiment (derived from more than 52 million Twitter messages). We highlight this method's potential—for M&A and other areas of strategy research—to open up new lines of inquiry. © 2023 The Authors",
 "The resource-based view (RBV) is one of the most influential perspectives in the organizational sciences. Although entrepreneurship researchers are increasingly leveraging the RBV's tenets, it emerged in strategic management. Despite some important similarities between entrepreneurship and strategic management, there are also important differences, raising questions as to whether and to what extent the RBV needs to be adapted for the entrepreneurship field. As a first step toward answering these questions, this study focuses on resources as the fundamental building block of the RBV and presents a content-analytical comparison of researchers' and practicing entrepreneurs' resource conceptualizations to derive similarities and differences between established theory and entrepreneurial practice. We find that although the two conceptualizations exhibit some overlap, there are also important differences in the emphasis on different dimensions of resources and ownership requirements, as well as in the understanding of how those resources shape outcomes. These results suggest important contextual conditions when applying the RBV's tenets within the field of entrepreneurship. © 2016 International Council for Small Business.",
 "We revisit Andrew Pettigrew's seminal 'Context and action in the transformation of the firm', first published in this journal in November 1987. In doing so, we not only review Pettigrew's contributions, but contextualize these with respect to adjoining strategy scholarship. Our discussion concludes with some novel, and fairly speculative, ways forward, designed to advance strategy scholarship. Working with the ideas contained in Pettigrew's article and drawing on insights from institutional entrepreneurship, we make a case for the processualization of strategy content research. This allows us to add the issue of effectiveness of strategy practices to current strategy-as-practice research while arguing for a further humanization of strategic management. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.",
 'Research on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is rising but far from complete. This special issue (SI) aims to enhance our understanding of how firms in Asia and beyond strategically respond to the BRI and what new theories and investigations are needed to better elucidate this new environment. In this editorial, we present a brief description of BRI, a review of related studies in the international business (IB) domain, a summary of the articles included in the SI and their contributions to the study of BRI, and an agenda for future research. We suggest that more attention should be given to examination of organizational heterogeneity under the BRI theme. In particular, there exists a variety of players like the governments of the host countries, non-government institutions, firms with different ownership structures, managers with different backgrounds, and their idiosyncratic characteristics should be incorporated in BRI studies. Moreover, future studies should find fine-grained ways to theorize and operationalize the policy effects of BRI. We call for further investigation of the consequences of BRI, including but not limiting to different aspects of IB activities, innovation, entrepreneurship, and corporate social responsibility. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',
 'We contrast conventional strategic approaches derived from neoclassical economics with a socio-ecological approach to strategy. We propose that the socio-ecological approach, and specifically the causal textures theory of organizational environments it spawned, helps strategic planners to better engage the unpredictable uncertainty that characterizes turbulent environments. To support our argument, we render explicit three principles that have been implicit in causal textures theory. We articulate general strategic planning stances for organizations consistent with each of the three principles, and demonstrate how scenario planning can help to instantiate each principle. We conclude that causal textures theory helps strategic planners to better understand the purpose of scenario planning and helps to guide them on how to make use of scenario planning to effect better strategies in a turbulent environment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',
 "The rapid international expansion by financial services firms since the early 1990s has occurred in the absence of any consistent evidence of such growth being associated with performance gains. Opportunism and imitation are identified as the key drivers of cross-border expansion, suggesting that internationalisation strategies need to be based on a more rigorous analysis of the sources of cross-border value creation. Applying Ghemawat's 'Triple-A' global strategy analysis framework identifies the sources of value creation from internationalisation in financial services, but also reveals the internal diversity of the financial services sector with regard to product and national market differences. Hence internationalisation strategies need to be uniquely tailored to the positioning and competitive advantages of individual financial services companies. These complexities of internationalisation strategy in financial services pose massive challenges to strategy implementation. The greatest management problem for financial services multinationals is to design structures and systems that can reconcile the (often very) divergent strategic requirements of different products and markets. The scale of this problem increases with additional product and international diversity. The organisational structures and systems of coordination and control that have proven effective for industrial multinationals have been less successful for financial services multinationals, partly because of the latters' greater strategic complexity and partly because the requirements for effective risk management create major barriers to decentralization. Given these challenges, financial services firms need to avoid the overconfidence that has characterised their aggressive international expansion of recent years, and adopt cross-border strategies that are sequential, experimental and adaptive. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

 'The meanings held by events are sometimes transferable to a brand through sponsorship. The perceived sponsor-property fit affects brand evaluations. This research hypothesizes that in the case of a sponsorship portfolio, the source of image transfer can be composite, and brand image association may depend on the perceived fit between sponsorships. Building on theories of social cognition and categorization, this research proposes two dimensions of fit: sponsorship category relatedness and event personality fit. Two experiments show that categorical relatedness between sponsorships not only leads to the creation of a unified brand personality for the sponsor, but also enhances brand meaning consistency and clarity. Central category-related traits cue a category membership framework that integrates sponsorships in the portfolio. Under conditions of category ambiguity, the impact of event personality fit emerges. Interestingly, the findings suggest that sponsored properties having a "spiky" brand personality (having both high and low performance on dimensions) may communicate most clearly in a portfolio. © 2010.',
 'Many of the most successful firms—such as Alibaba, Google, and Uber—operate platforms. Electric vehicles (EVs) are platform goods as well because value comes from the vehicle plus complementary providers. Gasoline vehicles are also platform goods, but managers in the industry can ignore that because the refueling network is mature. However, temporal and structural differences in network effects for electric vehicles make it crucial for EV firms to incorporate platform strategies. This article explains these differences and outlines the key platform strategy decisions that EV firms need to make, including platform network coordination, launch, and openness. © The Regents of the University of California 2022.',
 'We examine whether firms that face increased competition are more likely to seek uniformity in the incentive payments made to top management teams (TMTs). Motivated by social comparison theory, we conjecture that variation in executive incentive payments will reduce as a strategic response to encourage TMT cooperation. We test this hypothesis by examining how TMT incentive dispersion changes following exogenous product market competition shocks from reduced tariff cuts. Matched difference-in-differences regressions on a large sample of manufacturing firms between 1992 and 2019 support our prediction. Firms experiencing large tariff cuts are associated with both lower total- and equity-incentive dispersion. This effect is stronger for firms with more powerful CEOs, suggesting that CEOs are a key channel for implementing the strategic use of TMT incentives in firms facing external competition. © 2023 The Author(s)',
 'In 2013, the global mobile app market was estimated at over US$50 billion and is expected to grow to $150 billion in the next two years. In this paper, we build a structural econometric model to quantify the vibrant platform competition between mobile (smartphone and tablet) apps on the Apple iOS and Google Android platforms and estimate consumer preferences toward different mobile app characteristics. We find that app demand increases with the in-app purchase option wherein a user can complete transactions within the app. On the contrary, app demand decreases with the in-app advertisement option where consumers are shown ads while they are engaging with the app. The direct effects on app revenue from the inclusion of an in-app purchase option and an in-app advertisement option are equivalent to offering a 28% price discount and increasing the price by 8%, respectively. We also find that a price discount strategy results in a greater increase of app demand in Google Play compared with Apple App Store, and app developers can maximize their revenue by providing a 50% discount on their paid apps. Using the estimated demand function, we find that mobile apps have enhanced consumer surplus by approximately $33.6 billion annually in the United States, and we discuss various implications for mobile marketing analytics, app pricing, and app design strategies. © 2014 INFORMS.',
 'Often we unconsciously take for granted that there is not really an alternative to how we currently organize society – we tend to reify existing social order, misperceiving the way things are now as the way things must be. Such reification constrains our agency by discouraging the thought that we could do better. Alternative organizations undermine this reification by manifesting the real possibility of organizing differently. Such dereification is valuable in itself insofar as it lifts constraints on agency, facilitating intentional choice regarding the social systems we (re)produce. A case study of this dereification is offered by the Réseau Alimentaire Local (RAL), a network of French ‘solidarity groceries’ unified by the pursuit of more just and sustainable alternatives to the dominant model. Groups within the RAL develop their own software to manage these novel alternatives. We were struck, however, by some groups’ efforts to reify their own solutions, disparaging other approaches as mere attempts to ‘reinvent the wheel’. The case thus raised a tricky question: can alternative organizations dereify existing social order without at the same time reifying their proposal, thereby reimposing constraints on agency? Our exploration through the RAL case grounds two contributions. First, conceptualizing reification in terms of materializing abstract ideas, we demonstrate how any given organizational configuration contributes to the materialization of multiple ideas simultaneously. We identify two forms of such multiplicity: vertical multiplicity, where nested relational networks materialize coherent ideas that differ only in their degree of specificity; and horizontal multiplicity, where intersecting relational networks materialize divergent ideas of the same degree of specificity. We argue that failure to recognize this multiplicity accounts for a great deal of materiality’s reifying capacity, while its recognition can facilitate new ways of approaching the dereification challenge. Our second contribution is therefore a strategy for resisting reification: materializing multiplicity. © The Author(s) 2024.',
 "As consumers heavily rely on price to make purchases, cashback rewards apps are termed as a strategy in the retail context. Accordingly, retailers are increasingly using price strategies based on providing cashback back to develop loyalty programs. However, retailers have little insight into how different cashback price strategies, such as cashback generation and cashback redemption, yield loyalty and financial benefits for them. Using a conceptual framework, the authors link cashback price strategies to consumers' loyalty towards the program, which in turn boosts consumers' average purchase amount and retailers' revenues. The analysis uses time-series data from a cashback program merged with retailers' revenues and consumer average purchase amount. Results demonstrate that cashback generation and retention increase consumer's loyalty towards the cashback. Second, program loyalty is a strong driver of customer average purchase and retailing revenues. Third, retailers can use cashback generation and retention for increasing firm’ performance by evoking consumer program loyalty. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",
 "This study investigated the performance implications of private firms appointing their CEOs to serve as the firms' Communist Party Secretaries in China. Integrating insights from the corporate political strategy literature and institutional theory, this study used a panel dataset of Chinese privately controlled and listed firms covering 2008 through 2019 to investigate CEO/Communist Party Secretary duality as a special political strategy. The effect on firm performance was shown to vary depending on the institutional environment in which a firm operated. CEO/Communist Party Secretary duality enhanced firm performance for firms in less developed regions, where state logic was more influential. But it hampered firm performance in better developed regions, where market logic was more influential. Furthermore, indicators of firms’ inclination to state logic versus market logic were found to influence the effectiveness of CEO/Communist Party Secretary duality on firm performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",
 'New ventures often experience deviations from their plans that oblige them to reorient in pursuit of a better fit between their evolving products and their target customers. Yet, research is largely silent on how managers explain such changes and justify their ventures in the wake of fundamental redirections in strategy. Ventures initially attain legitimacy and amass resources on the strength of aims that audiences find compelling; later, those early claims can complicate course corrections. To shed light on how ventures manage strategic reorientations, we conducted an inductive, comparative case study of ventures in a nascent financial-technology sector. The ventures pursued parallel reorientations and produced comparable end products but diverged conspicuously in managing audiences during transitions. Our process model, inspired by these differences, proposes a sequence of stratagems that may enable entrepreneurs to alter strategy while portraying faithfulness to enduring aims. Our theoretical framework posits that, for ventures, reorientation without penalty may depend on how they anticipate, justify, and stage changes to various audiences. © 2019 INFORMS.',
 "The principal-principal (PP) perspective of corporate governance shows that multiple large shareholder (MLS) structure has competing monitoring and entrenchment governance effects. We argue that the dominant effect depends on contest for control among large shareholders and the number of large shareholders involved. Using data from Chinese family listed companies from 2004 to 2007, this study shows inverse U-shaped relationships between contest for control and corporate market value, as measured by Tobin's Q, and between the number of large shareholders and corporate market value. Findings indicate that at low to medium levels of contest for control or number of large shareholders, formal institutions can strengthen MLS structure's monitoring effect and can help this effect last longer. As a whole, the findings extend the institution-based view in the context of family corporate governance by showing that formal institutions can shape the ability of MLS structure to exert governance. © 2012 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.",
 "The size of cashback sites, both in terms of users and business, has grown considerably over the last decade. This article presents a complete analysis of the behavior of the users of the webs both in terms of transactions, and navigation and registration on cashback sites by using a large sample of one of the largest European sites. The study also presents a first analysis on the structure of the sites. An analysis using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling shows that the volume of the user's network, the diversification of the navigation, and the size of the transactions are relevant to the decision of the consumer and to his or her engagements on the affiliate merchants. These results represent a first step on the understanding of these marketing strategies and open new areas of research. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Building on the literature relating to bank market structure and on the research analysing costs and benefits of concentrated credit relationships, this article aims to empirically assess whether, and to what extent, local credit market concentration impacts on SME default riskiness - making this impact conditional on the closeness of lending relationships. Controlling for inertia, unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity, we find that bank market concentration positively and significantly affects SME default riskiness when these firms borrow heavily from their main bank and have few credit relationships with other intermediaries. Furthermore, according to our evidence, the influence of credit market concentration on firm default probability is greater as the duration of (close) credit relationships lengthens. © The Author(s) 2011.',
 'The key elements of the Uppsala school paradigm of the internationalization process of the firm are the historical context to which it applies and the micro-foundations that shape firm internationalization. Technological, institutional, and political developments of recent decades have fundamentally changed both the context of international business activities and the managerial practices that guide firm behavior. Consequent revisions of the model shifted its focus from ‘internationalization’ to ‘evolution’ in firms more generally, thereby undermining its relevance and paradigmatic status. This calls for a new conceptual basis and a ‘paradigm shift’ in research on the internationalization process of the firm. To promote this endeavor, this Counterpoint advocates the explicit adoption of historical perspectives, such as that of the original Uppsala studies, and methodologies, especially ‘archeological’ discourse analysis, as originally developed by Michel Foucault. Its aim is to understand the process of knowledge creation in specific societal contexts. Combined with social constructivist approaches to the sociology of knowledge, it could fruitfully be applied to the analysis of the formation and content of beliefs and practices regarding the efficacy of different internationalization strategies, as they have evolved in business firms and other relevant epistemic communities, such as those of professional experts or industries. © 2021, Academy of International Business.',
 'We describe an actionable research approach for addressing current challenges to theoretical advancement labeled theory elaboration. Theory elaboration is the process of conceptualizing and executing empirical research using preexisting conceptual ideas or a preliminary model as a basis for developing new theoretical insights by contrasting, specifying, or structuring theoretical constructs and relations to account for and explain empirical observations. We identify and describe seven specific tactics for conducting a theory elaboration study: horizontal contrasting, vertical contrasting, new construct specification, construct splitting, structuring specific relations, structuring sequence relations, and structuring recursive relations. We also link each tactic with different types of theory advancements. In addition, we provide a sequential decision-making process for deciding whether to adopt a theory elaboration approach given a particular research domain and context. Finally, we identify research domains and specific topics in organizational behavior, human resource management, strategic management, and entrepreneurship for which theory elaboration is likely to be most effective as a means to make theoretical advancements. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.',
 'The link between the field of information technology business value and sustainable activities is a widely discussed topic in academia and management. However, the mechanisms that lead to the impact on business performance are still elusive. The circular economy is one of the most recent approaches to address sustainability challenges. Drawing on the perspective of information technology-enabled organizational capabilities and contingency theory, this study is one of the first to analyze how information systems capabilities enable circular economy practices to become higher-order capabilities that enhance business performance, as well as the moderation that environmental uncertainty exerts on this relationship. Using partial least squares path modeling, empirical evidence demonstrates that circular economy practices fully mediate the relationship between information systems capabilities and business performance. Meanwhile, environmental uncertainty negatively moderates both the impact of circular economy practices on business performance and the mediation of circular economy practices in the information systems capabilities-business performance relationship. For managers, this research demonstrates how embedding information systems capabilities into organizational processes for transitioning to a circular economy model can present economic benefits depending upon the uncertainty within their specific operating environment. Finally, our mediation analysis method combines predictive and causal techniques with partial least squares structural equation modeling and applies a compelling approach to testing conditional mediation effects. © 2024 The Author(s)',
 'This paper studies a decentralized supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer facing price- and leadtime-sensitive demands. A Stackelberg game is constructed to analyze the price and lead time decisions by the supplier as the leader and the retailer as the follower. The equilibrium strategies of the two players are obtained. Using the performance of the corresponding centralized system as a benchmark, we show that decentralized decisions in general are inefficient and lead to inferior performance due to the double marginalization effect. However, further analysis shows that the decision inefficiency is strongly influenced by market and operational factors, and if the operational factors are dominating, it may not be significant. This shows that before pursuing a coordination strategy with retailers, a supplier should first improve his or her own internal operations. © 2007 INFORMS.',
 'Consumers’ strategic use of brands as a way of influencing the impressions others have about them is buttressed by research showing that brand personality traits may carry over and affect perceptions about their users or endorsers. However more often than not brand users engage in all sorts of trait-implying behaviors that may sometimes be in conflict with the brand personality. In two studies we explored how perceivers integrate these two sources of information when creating first impressions of brand users. Results indicated that when traits associated with brands and the users’ trait-implying behaviors were in conflict, brand trait transferences were inhibited, whereas traits inferred from the behaviors were enhanced. These findings concerning brand trait transference inhibition and trait inference enhancement may provide new insights on how brand personality influences perceptions about their users, with distinctive consequences for marketing strategy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Using a database on innovation activities by Spanish firms, we perform an exploratory analysis on a frequently overlooked area of research: innovation investment decisions by small firms in rural areas where socioeconomic indicators are weak. We focus on two quite different sectors of interest there, agri-food and t-KIBS firms, to explore how the regional context influences the capacity and the nature of innovation. Following the TOE approach as a conceptual framework, we perform a multivariate statistical analysis based on MCA and PCA combined, to identify the most relevant factors among a list of 73 indicators in four broad domains, including innovation decisions as well as organizational, technological, and environmental determinants. The exploratory results obtained suggest an open field of research. Thus, we observe a distinctive behavior of marketing innovation by agri-food firms that is related to former ICT experience, whereas services innovation by t-KIBS would be related to the objective of entering new market niches. Some results confirm previous results for SMEs outside rural areas, such as financial constraints, lack of qualified personnel, and strong competition being relevant barriers to invest in R&D by t-KIBS firms. Contrariwise, we dispute the assertion that agri-food firms are primarily oriented toward product and process innovation: what comes together is product and organizational innovation. © 2019 International Council for Small Business.',
 'Corporate rebranding that modifies logos, tagline and the corporate brand name is common among practitioners. Available literature reports the success of corporate rebranding by the response and perception of external stakeholders but there is little reflection of the internal perspective. Employees however represent the brand values and fulfil the corporate brand promise. To fill this gap a multiple case study approach was adopted, and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted followed by thematic analysis of the data. Findings of the study emphasized upon the role of rebranding communication by leadership in facilitating changes to the corporate brand, resulting in employee buy-in. This important contribution to the literature will also help managers achieve employee buy-in to strategic changes in the organisation especially post Brexit. Further research is recommended to measure existing levels of employee engagement and corporate brand identification that will support post rebranding employee buy-in. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',

 'This paper sketches the contours of a theory of entrepreneurship focusing on the nature of entrepreneurship as intermediation under information asymmetries. While entrepreneurship, strategy, and finance researchers have studied the relationship between entrepreneurs and intermediaries, they tend to treat intermediaries, such as venture capitalists, as a separate organizational form that is parallel with (start-up) entrepreneurs. In this paper, we consider entrepreneurs as intermediaries who discover, create, and exploit entrepreneurial opportunities by bearing uncertainties stemming from intermediation between potential buyers and sellers under information asymmetries. Specifically, we focus on two key questions in entrepreneurship research: (1) Why do entrepreneurs arise and exist at all? (2) Why do some entrepreneurs perform better than others in creating entrepreneurial opportunities and ultimately creating wealth? Our discussion culminates in a new research agenda with four testable propositions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.',
 "Based on interviews and documentary analysis, we analyzed the mechanisms being adopted by the HQ of Huawei, a Chinese MNC, for controlling the outputs and processes of its foreign subsidiaries and social behaviours within them and how these controls were supported by corresponding strategies of legitimation. The controls comprise key performance indicators, standard operating procedures, divided subsidiary mandates, HQ-centric rotational expatriation, military-style induction, public oath-taking and self-criticism ceremonies, and training in and role-modelling of core values. The HQ provides comprehensive legitimation for each of these control mechanisms, drawing on five strategies of legitimation, which comprise espousals of organizational benefits, inducement, affirmation, moral exhortation, and narrativization. In many cases, the legitimizing statements have been provided by Mr. Ren, Huawei's founder and CEO, whose authority appears to have been important in conferring legitimacy to the HQ. The historical path of Huawei's development as an MNC has also been salient in conferring legitimacy to the HQ. Our findings suggest that interviewees regard the controls as legitimate, that the subsidiaries broadly comply with the controls, and that micro-political contestation is largely absent.

 "Research Summary: This study examines the role of international institutional complexity, which is defined as the scope and multiplicity of institutional dimensions across foreign markets, on emerging market multinational companies’ (EMMCs) innovation performance. We propose that international institutional complexity provides learning opportunities for EMMCs’ innovation performance but also incurs higher management costs to handle information overload from overextended internationalization. We further propose that the host exposure and the heterogeneity of an EMMC's top management team (TMT) moderate the main effect of international institutional complexity on EMMC innovation. The empirical testing utilizes a longitudinal panel dataset of 7,072 foreign expansion steps by 767 Chinese firms from 2001 and 2010 and offers strong support for the proposed hypotheses. Managerial Summary: Despite the emergence of EMMCs over the past 30 years, there is little understanding of how international institutional complexity impacts EMMCs’ innovation capabilities. By analyzing a longitudinal panel dataset of 7,072 foreign expansion steps by 767 Chinese firms from 2001 and 2010, we find that the international institutional complexity of an EMMC has an inverted U-shaped impact (first increasing and then decreasing) on its innovation, such that a moderate level of international institutional complexity generates the most innovation output. We also find that TMT host exposure and TMT heterogeneity positively moderate the relationship between international institutional complexity and EMMCs’ innovation performance. Our study contributes to better understanding EMMCs’ international strategies in enhancing their innovation capabilities. Copyright © 2017 Strategic Management Society",
 "We examine the role of debt as a governance mechanism in balancing exploration and exploitation. We argue that while equity is conducive to uncertain exploration critical for innovation, debt provides countervailing incentives for engaging in exploitation by imposing cash flow obligations and the threat of bankruptcy. As a consequence, debt becomes a vital instrument in directing innovation along the optimal trajectory, while preventing the balance from shifting too far toward suboptimal exploration. To support our arguments, drawing on patent data, we first demonstrate that a firm's leverage is positively related to knowledge exploitation activity as reflected in its self-citations. Next, we show that firms that have potentially engaged in suboptimal exploration, as manifest in underutilized stocks of proprietary knowledge, are likely to experience leverage increases in the short run, and these leverage increases in turn result in subsequent increases in self-citations. These effects are consistent with firm value indicating that equity holders value the role of debt in stimulating exploitation. Our study draws attention to the complementary roles of equity and debt as governance mechanisms in balancing exploration/exploitation, while outlining the role of debt in innovation in greater depth. © 2016 INFORMS.",
 "A platform is a triadic exchanging system with two-sided customers, it faces heterogeneous or even conflicting consumer needs from both sides. According to the theory of inventive problem solving, needs' contradictions are an important source of innovation. Adopting different customer orientation (CO) strategies will affect the platform's utilization of customer needs and thus influence the results of innovation. Our study divides platform CO into one-sided CO and two-sided CO and compares their relative effects on a platform's radical and incremental innovation. We also assess whether the impacts are conditional on the platform's top management team's (TMT) formal and informal status. Archival data from 126 electronic platforms revealed that two-sided CO promotes both radical and incremental innovation, but one-sided CO influences incremental innovation. Furthermore, TMT formal status positively moderates the impact of CO on radical innovation, but TMT informal status negatively moderates the effect of CO on incremental innovation. © 2021",
 'In this study I propose a general transaction-cost economics (TCE) model of international business institutions, in which cross-border transactions can be conducted at multiple market levels (e.g., output, asset, and equity), and the buyer-seller relationship can go both ways (A sells to B, and B sells to A). This general model addresses two major gaps in the literature. First, although market failure is the driving force behind the rise of multinational enterprises (MNEs), most researchers have focused on the failure of a single market without exploring the presence of substitute markets for cross-border transactions. Second, many previous studies have begun their analysis with a bilateral setup between an MNE and an indigenous firm (for example, a licensing agreement), but concluded with a unilateral decision made by the MNE to evade the indigenous firm (in the case of direct investment). In bridging the two literature gaps, I propose a general TCE model to integrate all institutional modes available to firms for governing international business, such as licensing, outsourcing, acquisitions, and joint ventures. Built on a multi-market framework, my analysis reveals that the choice of the optimal international business institution is tantamount to the selection of the most efficient market to conduct cross-border transactions. Drawing on a bilateral setup, it explicitly recognizes the power of reciprocity in solving the problem of market failure. This distinct approach points out promising directions for future researchers to advance international business studies, particularly after my transaction-level analysis has been expanded to also consider institutional contexts and firm capabilities. © 2010 Academy of International Business.

 "Our study, which complements recent works challenging the traditional conceptualization of the CHQ as a single organizational unit, has a dual purpose. First, in descriptive terms, we set out to explore the prevalence of spatially dispersed CHQs in a historical context. Second, we aim to shed additional light on the CHQ's spatial design by exploring internal antecedents and potential consequences. Building on arguments from information-processing theory, we propose that the strategic complexity facing the CHQ (affecting its information-processing demands) is associated with the likelihood of a spatially dispersed CHQ (affecting its information-processing capacity). In line with our dual purpose, we conduct a historical study drawing on survey and archival data covering 156 public firms domiciled in four countries (Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US) in the late 1990s. Our results provide empirical support for the hypothesized associations between strategic complexity and the CHQ's spatial design. Moreover, although we find no empirical support for the expected contingency effects, the results suggest that a spatially dispersed CHQ can have negative effects on CHQ and firm performance. Overall, our theoretical arguments and empirical results advance our knowledge about complex CHQ configurations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
 "Under the fierce pressures of the fast changing environments that characterize emerging economies, firms must develop dynamic capabilities to survive the competition. This study examines how strategic orientation helps build dynamic capability and its contingencies in China's emerging economy. A survey of 380 firms indicates strategic orientations are important drivers of adaptive capability, a key element of dynamic capabilities. The effectiveness of strategic orientations is contingent on market dynamics. In particular, when market demand becomes increasingly uncertain, customer orientation has a weaker impact, whereas technology orientation has a stronger effect on adaptive capability. As competition intensifies, both competitor and technology orientations build adaptive capability more effectively. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
 "The role of fellow customers in webcare remains underexplored in the literature. To address this gap, the current study examines how observers perceive and react to a retailer's responses to online consumer complaints. Specifically, this work examines reactions to two service recovery strategies rooted in different dimensions of social cognition: warmth-oriented responses, which emphasize a retailer's friendliness; and competence-oriented responses, which emphasize a retailer's knowledge about products/services. In addition, the moderating role of the observer's relationship orientation is examined. Results suggest that, compared to competence-oriented messages, warmth-oriented service recovery messages are more likely to enhance observers’ service perceptions in the online environment, leading to satisfaction with service recovery efforts and positive word-of-mouth intentions (Study 1). Furthermore, relationship orientation serves as a boundary condition in the effect of service recovery strategy on observers’ service perceptions (Study 2). © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Publicly traded Chinese firms recently reformed their ownership structures by converting non-tradable shares, which constituted two-thirds of shares outstanding and were held largely by the state, into shares that could trade on domestic exchanges. To facilitate this reform, tradable shareholders were compensated with stock grants from non-tradable shareholders. Our analysis focuses on the level of compensation, the compensation ratio, the ratio of new tradable shares granted to tradable shares outstanding before the reform. Contrary to the predictions of asset-pricing models, most firms set the compensation ratio around 0.3. We explain this surprising convergence using institutional theory. In doing so, we analyze the power and interests of all relevant actors - not just owners, but also state regulators, executives, and other agents - and draw on insights from resource-dependence and agency theories. We find strong evidence of coercive and mimetic isomorphism, but no evidence of normative isomorphism. Because our dependent variable is continuous (a ratio), we are able to show that the mimetic effects we observe cannot be attributed to coercion or norms. Thus, we not only explain an empirical puzzle, we also advance institutional analysis of isomorphism by clearly distinguishing three isomorphic forces that have been conflated in much previous research. © 2012 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.',
 "The factors that determine firms’ levels of internationalization remain a focal area of international business research. Within this research stream, studies building on the upper echelons theory have investigated the influence of the demographic characteristics of the top management team (TMT) on firms’ international expansion. However, the literature to date has overlooked the TMT's overall degree of internationalization as a key driver of firm-level internationalization. In our paper, we argue that by having self-selected into careers abroad, foreign TMT members by definition have a higher cognitive tolerance of foreignness than domestic TMT members do. We theorize that foreign TMT members’ higher cognitive tolerance for foreignness enhances the overall TMT's level of international attention and international trust, thereby facilitating strategic decisions that favor firm-level internationalization. Additionally, we propose two key contingencies that attenuate this relationship: the institutional diversity of the firm's home region and the firm's global focus. Analysis of Fortune Global 500 firms supports the hypothesized relationship between TMT internationalization and firm-level internationalization, as well as the two moderation effects. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",
 "Entry strategy influences the success and survival of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in foreign market. Because foreign-market entry is a multilevel phenomenon, foreign ownership research could greatly benefit from studies using multilevel modeling and statistical analysis. Therefore, this research discusses these factors at the subsidiary level, the parent company level, and the dyad level between the subsidiary and its parent company. This research helps MNEs clarify the theoretical framework when deciding their ownership percentage in foreign investment. By using Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) analysis and fsQCA (fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis) to simultaneously consider 3-level factors, MNEs may reduce blind search costs, and gain enhanced understanding of various perspectives. The complementariness between the 2 parties, and the number and capabilities of subsidiaries affect the parent company's subsidiary-ownership decision, providing managerial insights for making optimal ownership decisions, and improving foreign investment performance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",
 "Psychosocial risk is a concern for employers across Europe. Psychosocial risk management, however, is younger than other risk management fields such as safety, hygiene, and ergonomics. Psychosocial risk control prevents accidents and absenteeism. This study examines strategies for psychosocial risk management in manufacturing organizations. The study employs structural equation modeling to analyze results of the European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER), a survey that fills an information gap concerning health and safety at work. The analysis yields three latent variables: psychosocial safety management, health and safety activities, and psychosocial performance. The study shows the benefits of adopting psychosocial safety management systems to improve psychosocial risk performance. Psychosocial preventive activities mediate the relationship between psychosocial safety management and psychosocial performance. Effective psychosocial risk management's benefits are so great that policymakers should specifically promote psychosocial risk management. Promoting psychosocial management systems and psychosocial preventive activities is likely to effectively improve overall psychosocial performance in European countries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",

 "Some scholars hold that dynamic capability is one of the key in searching for competitive advantage in strategic management. But there are still debates on the definition and effects of dynamic capabilities and the role of environmental dynamism. In the context of Chinese-like emerging economies, from a strategic process perspective, this study defines dynamic capability as the firms' potential to systematically solve problems, formed by its propensity to sense opportunities and threats, to make timely decisions, and to implement strategic decisions and changes efficiently to ensure the right direction, and also explores the relationship between dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage and, the role environmental dynamism plays. With an empirical study of 217 enterprises in China, this study finds that dynamic capabilities do significantly positively affect competitive advantage, and environmental dynamism is a driver rather than a moderator. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",
 "Organizational discourse has emerged as a large research field and references to discourse are numerous. As with all dominating approaches problematizations of assumptions are important. This article, partly a follow up of the authors' frequently cited 2000 Human Relations article, provides a critical and perhaps provocative overview of some of the more recent work and tendencies within the field. It is argued that discourse continues to be used in vague and all-embracing ways, where the constitutive effects of discourse are taken for granted rather than problematized and explored. The article identifies three particular problems prevalent in the current organizational discourse literature: reductionism, overpacking, and colonization and suggests three analytical strategies to overcome these problems: counter-balancing concepts - aiming to avoid seeing 'everything' as discourse - relativizing muscularity - being more open about discourse's constitutive effects - and disconnecting discourse and Discourse through much more disciplined use of discourse vocabulary. © The Author(s) 2011.",
 "Purpose: Drawing upon upper echelon, regulatory focus and attention theories and focusing on SMEs, the purpose of this paper is to answer questions on how the motivational disposition (promotion vs. prevention regulatory focus) of CEOs affects their information search patterns (i.e. search selection and intensity) and consequently organizational level engagement in different types of innovation activities (exploration vs. exploitation). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was conducted collecting data from the CEOs of SMEs operating in the dynamic wine and spirits industry in Greece. The data were collected in two independent time streams and the proposed theoretical model was tested by applying OLS regression analysis. Findings: The current research provides evidence that differences in CEOs’ level of promotion and prevention focus trigger different information search selection and search intensity patterns. Nonetheless, the attention to innovation components act as mediators only in the hypothesized relationships between a CEO's level of prevention and promotion focus and exploration. Paradoxically, filtered through attention to innovation and triggered from the same motive, that is to reduce negative emotions, promotion focus CEOs choose to direct resources to exploitation and avoid investing in exploration, whilst the opposite was supported for prevention focus CEOs. Practical implications: The results highlight the important role of a CEO's regulatory focus orientation in promoting diverse attention to innovation patterns and firm-level innovation tendencies towards exploration and/or exploitation. Originality/value: This study's contributions extend and combine the theories of regulatory focus, UET and attention in the field of managerial/entrepreneurship behavior and innovation. Therefore, they are valuable for understanding the determinants of firm-level innovation choices (exploration vs. exploitation) in SMEs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
 'Interfaces are of growing importance for theorizing and testing the influence of strategic leaders on firm behavior and actions. But despite their relevance and ubiquity, the lack of a commonly accepted definition and unifying framework has hindered researchers’ ability to take stock, synthesize, and systematize extant knowledge. We first develop an encompassing definition and organizing framework to review 122 prior studies across three decades. We then chart promising directions for future research around three concepts central to the framework and review: (1) Why do interfaces occur? (2) What happens at these interfaces? and (3) What are the impacts of interfaces? Together, the encompassing definition, framework, review, and specific directions for future research provide the much needed platform to agglutinate research and advance strategic leader interfaces as the next frontier of strategic leadership research. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.',
 'This study examines the measurement of performance for international new ventures (INVs). While there is a growing area of literature on INVs that includes the internationalisation patterns, networks and entry strategies of these firms, there is generally a lack of research on how INVs measure their own performance. Using a sequential mixed methods approach of exploratory interviews and a survey sample of 310 firms from New Zealand and Australia, we find that INVs tend to be significantly more international performance oriented than non-INVs. Our study also indicates that financial performance measures are generally viewed as more important than operational indicators. In addition, we find that manufacturing INVs generally place more importance on financial performance than service INVs. The study offers two key contributions to the literature: (1) an integrated examination of international performance measures as used in practise by INVs, and (2) a comparative perspective between INVs and non-INVs in terms of performance measurement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',
 "Despite the popularity of CEO duality as a research topic, relatively few empirical studies have explored the antecedents of this leadership structure. Prior research has generally produced null findings concerning the role of firm performance in predicting whether firms decide to separate (or combine) the CEO and board chair roles. We consider CEO ownership to be an important boundary condition that will help explain why the direct effects of these relationships lack significant results. Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms over a ten year span that begins with the 2008 financial crisis—a period in which CEO duality has experienced renewed scrutiny—we find that there is no direct effect between a firm's performance and the likelihood that the board will separate (or combine) the CEO and board chair roles. However, we find that CEO ownership is a significant moderating factor when observing how poor (good) performance can affect the likelihood of separating (combining) these roles. © 2021",
 "Companies have vigorously pursued opportunities for profitability and growth through international venturing. Yet, research evidence on the performance benefits of international venturing activities has been contradictory. Applying an organizational learning framework, we propose that the expected effects of international venturing activities on financial performance depend on companies' absorptive capacity. Data from 217 global manufacturing companies show that absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between international venturing and firms' profitability and revenue growth. These results urge executives to build internal R&D and innovative capabilities in order to successfully exploit the new knowledge acquired from foreign markets. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

 'We explore the determinants of absorptive capacity by examining how managers of MNE subsidiaries operating in emerging markets recognize, assimilate and apply external knowledge. From analysis of the subsidiaries of 12 MNEs with data from a total of 62 informants from China, India, Brazil and Kenya, six constructs emerged: prior knowledge significance, unlearning, explorative scanning, transformative learning, exploitative application and organization context. Through the iteration of data and theory, we develop a model, which presents a process framework that suggests the dynamic relationships among the emergent concepts underlying absorptive capacity. By identifying and explicating key actions and practices that have previously been largely treated as implicit in the absorptive capacity literature, the study enriches understanding of the micro-processes of absorptive capacity. © 2019, The Author(s).',
 "This article builds on the theorizing of body work through introducing a new concept: 'maternal body work'. In so doing, it shows how progress towards a feminist politics of motherhood within organizations remains limited. Despite decades of feminist scholarship, dissonances remain between the private worlds of reproduction and public worlds of organization. With regard to this limited progress, the article reveals how, among a sample of 27 mothers (all professionally and managerially employed in the UK), 22 felt marginalized and undervalued at work, experiencing the borders between maternity and organization as unmalleable. By contrast, five women treated borders between reproduction and organization as more fluid than anticipated. Setting a high value on their skills, they developed strategies for parrying unfavourable revisions of their status. The article concludes by considering the potential development of resources for enhancing maternal coping strategies. © The Author(s) 2013.",
 "When faced with a sudden economic crisis, top managers come under pressure to persist and recover, but such an ability to be resilient depends on the collective response of the top management team (TMT). In particular, we argue that attention towards the future, or future focus, within the TMT influences the organization's resilience in times of crisis. Drawing on a sample of insurance companies during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), we mined earnings call transcripts to capture future focus for executives and aggregate this variable to the team level. Our results indicate that companies with TMTs high on average future focus, and companies with TMTs low on heterogeneity of future focus are more resilient - experiencing more moderate performance losses during the crisis and a swifter recovery after the crisis. With heightened attention on long-term effects of economic crises, we contribute to scholarship and practice by demonstrating that future focus within executive teams impacts their organization's resilience. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
 'In this study we explore the mediating role of managerial ability in the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance. Drawing on diversity, gender, and upper echelon theories, we propose that the addition of unique female perspectives and leadership styles will afford gender-diverse TMTs a managerial capability advantage over equally talented yet homogeneous male teams; and this link between gender diversity and managerial capability will be more pronounced in times of crisis. Our results confirm our hypotheses. Our key finding is that increasing female representation in TMTs has a substantial and direct influence on overall managerial capabilities and elicits positive performance effects both in times of stability and more so, in times of crisis. Notably, and unique to this study, we show that managerial ability completely (partially) mediates the gender diversity-performance link suggesting that feminine traits and transformational leadership styles are more efficacious in contemporary leadership contexts than generally believed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
 'We examine the procurement process selection problem of a large industrial buyer who employs reverse auctions for awarding procurement contracts. We contrast two classes of commonly used strategies under multiple sourcing; namely, single-stage reverse auctions, and two-stage processes where price-quantity adjustments between the buyer and the suppliers follow a first-stage reverse auction. Deriving bounds of efficiency for these two classes of procurement processes under convex supplier production costs, we present insights on the conditions under which each class is preferable for the buyer. Considering the effect of contracting and processing costs, a single-stage process is likely to be preferable to a two-stage process when the number of bidding suppliers is high, especially when capacity is rigid. A two-stage process with one information transfer in the second stage may be the preferred procurement mode when production is highly scalable, i.e., when the marginal production cost increase with increased production is small. When the number of suppliers is low, the effect of a decrease in production scalability depends on the current scalability level. For high scalability levels, a decrease in production scalability may decrease the efficiency of both single-stage and simple two-stage processes, whereas for low scalability levels, it tends to increase efficiency for both of these process classes. A decrease in production costs makes employing simple processes more attractive when production is highly scalable or when supplier capacity is rigid. For intermediate production scalability, however, a cost decrease may make employing two-stage processes with multiple information transfers in the second round preferable for the buyer. © 2009 INFORMS.',
 'Global offshoring has become a key strategy for international staffing, especially in the software industry. Global software teams engage in boundary spanning activities that may help MNEs achieve international connectivity and cope with external disruptions through their use of virtual work. However, offshoring IT professionals who bridge these boundaries in offshoring MNEs must contend with discontinuities, or perceived disruptions in expected communication flows, which impact their job satisfaction. Drawing on survey data from 193 professional consultants from an IT services offshoring MNE located primarily in Eastern Europe and working for a U.S. client, we test a model grounded in Organizational Discontinuity Theory. We find that potential discontinuities arising from the virtual work environment have no impact on the job satisfaction of offshoring IT professionals, but that those who experience team-level continuities of identification and shared vision are more satisfied with their jobs. Our findings suggest that virtual work may have become normalized such that it is not problematic in and of itself, and that fostering connectivity in boundary spanning global teams may be beneficial for MNEs. Our findings have important implications for MNEs managing disruptions created by global work arrangements as well as exogenous disruptions. © 2023 The Authors',
 "We use computer simulation to study how different allocations of decision rights give rise to different organizational abilities to maintain and act upon accurate maps of a changing environment. We compare the performance of three archetypal organizational forms as we vary the dynamism and complexity of the environment and the rates at which individuals can observe the environment and imitate each other. We find that teams in which actions are based on plurality votes excel when the task is relatively easy-that is, the ability of individual members to observe the environment is high compared to the environment's dynamism and size. Markets in which all agents act independently perform well when the task is difficult and the agents can easily imitate each other. Hierarchies in which agents in the upper echelons impose actions on their subordinates outperform the other two forms when the agents' abilities to observe the environment are heterogeneous, the task is difficult, and imitation among the agents is moderate. The analysis has implications for the relationship between centralization and the notions of exploitation and exploration in March's influential work [March JG (1991) Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. © 2012 INFORMS.",
 'In the examination of outsourcing and offshoring strategies to establish and orchestrate global value chains (GVCs), scholars have focused almost exclusively on two key decision dimensions – control and location – as the primary determinants of these complex organizational structures. However, the dynamic, temporal nature of GVCs can be further explained via a third organizing decision dimension that has received surprisingly little attention in this literature: time. This relates to the length of time that control and location settings are chosen ex ante to remain in effect. We explore this issue and assert that assignment durations are linked to activity type, and that mismatched durations can destroy value in even the most logically controlled and located GVC activities. We argue that while control and location are essential decisions for GVC orchestrators, how long these settings are in put into effect also plays a critical but overlooked role in efficient value chain organization. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.',
 'An in-depth look at the extant literature of dynamic capabilities (DCs) shows that the focus has been on the development, justification, and validation of individual DCs through both conceptual and empirical methods. We argue that studying DCs in isolation may not offer a complete practical meaning. Organizations being complex systems, multiple combinations of capabilities and their interrelationships (as a DC system) lead to a sustained competitive advantage, and this effect cannot be attributed to a single DC in isolation. Through this article, we present a system theoretic view of DCs and subsequently propose the concept of a DC ecosystem using a systems thinking perspective. We use the logical reasoning approach of justificationism to present the associated propositions. We conclude with a discussion of managerial implications and suggestions for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.',
 'Product innovation is conventionally treated as a mechanism for organizations to renew their product portfolios. In this paper, we suggest that product innovation not only enables organizations to introduce new products to the market but also challenges organizations to renew their technological capabilities. Capability stretching is the degree to which an organization extends its technological capabilities to bridge the gap between what it has already known and what the development of a new product requires it to know. Capability stretching can be challenging because it involves the acquisition and assimilation of new and distant knowledge. Drawing on a longitudinal study of product introductions in the workstation industry, we find that capability stretching reduces the chance of new product survival. Furthermore, we also find that organizational boundaries moderate the negative relationship between capability stretching and product survival: Vertical integration exacerbates this negative relationship, whereas horizontal boundary mitigates this negative relationship. However, capability stretching can also be rewarding, as it renews technological capabilities and therefore facilitates adaptation to technological changes. We draw implications for the linkages between product innovation and capability development. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.',
 'It is often argued that multinational corporations (MNCs) are in a unique position to innovate business models that can help to alleviate poverty. This empirical study into intra-organizational aspects of pro-poor business innovation in two MNCs suggests, however, that certain elements of their management frameworks - such as short-term profit interests, business unit based incentive structures, and uncertainty avoidance - may turn into obstacles that prevent MNCs from reaching their full potential in this respect. We introduce the concept of intrapreneurial bricolage to show how middle manager innovators may promote pro-poor business models despite these obstacles. We define intrapreneurial bricolage as entrepreneurial activity within a large organization characterized by creative bundling of scarce resources, and illustrate empirically how it helps innovators to overcome organizational constraints and to mobilize internal and external resources. Our findings imply that intrapreneurial bricolage may be of fundamental importance in MNC innovation for inclusive business. In addition to the field of inclusive business, this study has implications for the study of bricolage in large organizations and social intrapreneurship, as well for managerial practice around innovation for inclusive business. © 2012 The Authors.

 "Recent acquisitions involving Tumblr and Instagram have demonstrated that the takeover of an unlisted start-up company can offer enormous financial benefits to its (former) stakeholders. Considering the multimillion-dollar amounts paid for start-ups with no existing and highly uncertain future revenues, we investigate the process and outcome of negotiation dynamics in the context of takeovers. In a series of experiments, we show that even with a low level of uncertainty about a start-up's value and its financial resources, start-ups can influence bidders' behavior and consequently the start-ups' valuation. The results indicate that incumbents' bidding behavior is driven by the perceived threat level with respect to the start-up's business activities as well as by the uncertainty with respect to other incumbents' bidding behavior—drivers that are subject to activities by the start-ups' management. Interestingly, the effect even exists if incumbents clearly know that initiating a bidding process will very likely lead to losses. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",
 'This article demonstrates how the combined approaches of informed pluralism and disciplined integration can help rebridge the distance between the seemingly disparate academic worlds of family science and family business. The authors establish the need for such a resynthesis by documenting trends within family enterprise research from 1985 to 2010. The analysis vividly illustrates not only the increased dominance of publication outlets and theoretical perspectives associated with business but also the near disappearance of those associated with family. In light of these trends, the authors suggest that renewed attention to integrating ideas from the two disciplines is likely to enrich both. To illustrate this claim, this study combines concepts from long-standing theories within the family science literature (structural functionalism and symbolic interactionism) with those from predominant perspectives within the family business literature (agency theory and the resource-based view). The outcome is a series of provocative yet relevant potential new directions for each field. © The Author(s) 2012.',
 'The objective of this paper is to better understand the factors that competitive news providers consider to design or deliver news programmes. The focus is broadcast news where, in any programming time period, a viewer watches (or consumes) one programme. We assume that each viewer is interested in a limited set of topics and that her utility only comes from the "most interesting" news she observes. The key questions we address are as follows: (a) Should firms adopt designs that facilitate the delivery of more information in their news programmes? (b) Does the decision of firms to implement such strategies depend on the complexity of the news programme (i.e., the number of news stories covered in the news product)? (c) How do such strategies influence competition? We show that firms may or may not benefit by providing better-designed news. The incentive to do this is strongly affected by the complexity of the news product and the intensity of competition between news providers. ©2014 INFORMS.',
 'We provide evidence that cooperation is a cultural category, and that what it means to cooperate is culturally conditioned. We use a cultural consensus model analysis to assess which types of situations people categorize as cooperation and whether these categorizations are consistent within and across China and the United States. The data support revisiting the role of cognition in mediating cooperative behavior and the means by which culture shapes behavior. The data also support broadening research attention to multiple aspects of cooperation within the same theory, generating new research on reciprocity, and rethinking how key behaviors, such as competition and helping, relate to cooperation. © 2011 INFORMS.',
 'The current discipline of project management is based on the model of the project life cycle or phased stage-gate approach to executing projects. This implies a clear definition of mission and system are given at the outset (to reduce uncertainty), and subsequent execution in phases with decision gates. It contrasts with the approach applied in the seminal projects that are credited with establishing the foundation of the discipline in the 1940s and 1950s. Those projects started out with missions that were beyond the currently possible; any solutions had to emerge over time. They succeeded by a combination of parallel trials (from which the best would then be selected) and trialand-error iteration (allowing for the modification of solutions pursued over a period of time). Although the success of these approaches was well documented and explained by scientific study in the 1950s, today they seem to fly in the face of accepted professional standards, making managers uncomfortable when they are encountered. The project management discipline has been relegated to an "order taker niche"-the engineering execution of moderately novel projects with a clear mission. As a result, it has been prevented from taking center stage in the crucial strategic change initiatives facing many organizations today. The discipline of project management should be broadened in order to create greater value for organizations whose portfolios include novel and uncertain projects.',
 'How does middle managers’ sensemaking of other middle managers’ attitudes to a new strategy affect strategy implementation? We explore this question using a qualitative-abductive approach. Our investigation of the implementation of a top-down strategy in the plant of a multinational German engineering company revealed that middle managers experiencing ambiguity make sense of other middle managers’ attitudes to the strategy in social interactions. Based on their understanding of their colleagues’ attitudes, middle managers construct shared and separate realities about the strategy to be implemented. While shared realities are subjectively experienced commonalities, separate realities are subjectively experienced differences from others’ attitudes to the strategy. In our case, middle managers’ shared realities were associated with inaction on strategy implementation, whereas middle managers’ separate realities were related to initial actions to implement the strategy. Our findings suggest that middle managers’ sensemaking of other middle managers’ attitudes to a new strategy can shape their strategy implementation behavior. © 2023 The Authors',
 "Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to verify the importance of psychological ownership in the organisational context of a franchise by testing predicted relationships concerning feelings of ownership towards branding, legal ownership of complementary assets, organisational commitment, and a willingness on the part of franchisees to diffuse a franchise brand to peers. Design/methodology/approach - Evidence is presented from an empirical study on the largest taxi franchise fleet in Taiwan. Two formal questionnaires/surveys were conducted in May 2005 and September 2005, from which data were collected from 147 franchisees. Regression analysis is employed to test seven hypotheses. Findings - The empirical results demonstrate that analysing the psychological ownership of a franchise brand from two dimensions (i.e. the degree of psychological ownership and the self-centred propensity towards psychological ownership) sees an increase in explained variance in organisational commitment and brand diffusion in the context of the franchise organisation. It also illustrates that both dimensions of psychological ownership are negatively affected by the ownership of the non-brand-specified complementary assets owned by a franchisee. Research limitations/implications - The majority of previous research has investigated the phenomenon of franchising from the perspective of the agency theory or of resource scarcity; and has focused on the franchisor's concerns. A major implication of this study indicates that these perspectives, while essential, are insufficient in explaining the growth through franchising strategies. Researchers need to consider how to integrate asset ownership (or property rights) and affect elements in order to influence a franchisee's cognition and behaviour entrepreneurially. A limitation of this study is that it is conducted within the respective boundaries of cultural, professional, and industrial factors. Practical implications - This study indicates that entrepreneurs can achieve better brand diffusion effects for franchise growth if they engage in merging the structures of asset ownership and psychological ownership. Originality/value - This is the first paper to examine the psychological ownership of branding within the setting of a franchise organisation and highlights the importance of a sense of ownership in entrepreneurship. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",
 'This study contributes to our understanding of absorptive capacity (AC) by reviewing AC articles systematically using two types of blibliometric co-citation analysis – bibliometric co-citation and bibliometric cartography – for the last 25 years. In total, we analyzed 336 articles (using HistCite) and 2088 articles (using VOSviewer), respectively, finding five research streams in AC: (1) intra-organizational learning; (2) inter-organizational learning; (3) knowledge transfer; (4) dynamic capability; and (5) micro-foundations. This integrative literature review of AC adds to the categorization of the literature, links the international business research to AC, and provides promising future research directions. Our study gives detailed information about the development of each research stream by measuring the number of publications in each stream over 25 years using bibliometric cartography analysis. Based on the literature, we propose 26 future research questions for these five research streams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd',

 'We propose and contrast a model that integrates the factors influencing entry timing and the way entry timing influences firm performance, using a sample of firms that carry out international activities from the Information and Communications Technology Industry (ICT) in Spain. We found that capabilities are the main factor influencing firm performance. We also demonstrate that entry timing plays a significant mediator role in this relationship. Furthermore, we found that the utility strategy, which combines efforts in costs and differentiation, is a basic factor that explains and reinforces sustainable competitive advantages for those firms that enter early into the market. Managers need to analyse the implications of entry timing at length. In this sense, managers should evaluate if they have a suitable configuration of capabilities for entering the market successfully. They should also try to consolidate first mover advantages (FMAs), developing hybrid strategies that combine low cost and differentiation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Research Summary: Initial public offering (IPO) underpricing reflects the inability of early investors to capture the full value of an entrepreneurial firm. IPO firms can potentially limit underpricing by signaling wealth protection through lower chief executive officer (CEO) power. Such signaling is particularly challenging for many IPO firms, though, because for those doing business in high-power-distance cultures, CEO power can also signal wealth creation, making CEO power a mixed signal for IPO investors. Drawing on signaling theory, we argue that CEO power is positively associated with IPO underpricing, but this relationship weakens for IPO firms doing business in countries with high cultural power distance because the information signaled becomes less clear. The signaling impact of both CEO power and demand-side cultural power distance weakens, however, when underwriter reputation offers a substitute signal. Managerial Summary: This research offers new knowledge for IPO corporate governance practitioners, such as entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, underwriters, and regulators. Specifically, our research demonstrates that the power dynamic in the upper echelons has implications for demand-side legitimacy or making U.S.-listed firms more legitimate with international customers. As a result, stockholders and securities analysts who balk at the consolidation of CEO power should consider the potential benefits that such consolidation of power might grant the firm when competing in different cultural environments associated with foreign markets. © 2021 Strategic Management Society.',
 'The article assesses the proposition that ethnic and linguistic diversity is a potential source of competitive advantage at the city/regional level. Seven potential links between ethnic diversity and competitiveness are proposed on the basis of previous literature, although the article focuses on three: ethnic diversity as a source of creativity and innovation; the role of diaspora-based networks; and linguistic diversity, using a combination of secondary material and original case studies. The overall conclusion is that although a number of plausible hypothesized links between diversity and competitiveness are proposed, and evidence is presented to support them, further systematic research is required before the frequency of occurrence of such diversity/ competitiveness connections can be determined and their importance in economic development fully assessed. © The Author(s) 2010.',
 'This paper presents an empirical study of the impact of Walmart supercenter conversion on consumer shopping behavior. By using a difference-in-difference estimator, we find that Walmart gains 41% in weekly revenue from the conversion. Decomposing the revenue gains into components attributable to store visits and per-visit expenditures, we find that the majority of these gains were due to larger expenditures, with a much smaller impact from store visits. By contrast, among competing retailers, grocery stores experience the most significant loss (20% weekly revenue) mostly from fewer store visits, with a much smaller impact attributable to per-visit expenditure. Taken together, these findings show that consumers may benefit from reduced shopping costs by making fewer overall trips and increasing their Walmart basket sizes. In addition, we find that overall revenue gains for Walmart from conversion outweigh the small cannibalization loss at the existing Walmart supercenters located farther away. Finally, from category-level analyses, we find evidence of increases in category-level spending in preexisting categories in the converted supercenter. However, we also find that positive demand externality is more pronounced in food categories, mainly as a result of increased purchase incidence. We discuss the implications of our findings for academics and retail managers. © 2016 INFORMS.',
 'International trade in services is a dominant feature of the global economy but it has not received a corresponding level of attention in international business research. In this study, we review the status of research on the internationalisation of services and service firms in the international business domain in order to derive questions for future research.

In addition to providing a qualitative content analysis of the literature, we extend the study to all research published by 2018 to identify research gaps and emerging research themes. Overall, we find that while research on service internationalisation has increased, the field remains fragmented and lacks theoretical and conceptual development applicable to the internationalisation of services.

Platforms will impose stricter requirements for capital raisers, expand their services, and innovate their business models. National governments will probably partly liberalize the ECF market. © 2021 International Council for Small Business.',
 'Foundational to management is the idea that organizational decisions are a function of expected outcomes; hence, the customary empirical approach to employ multivariate techniques that regress performance outcome variables on discrete measures of organizational choices (e.g., investments, trainings, strategies and other managerial decision variables) potentially suffer from self-selection based endogeneity bias. Selection-effects represent an internal validity threat as they can lead to biased parameters that render erroneous empirical results and incorrect conclusions with regard to the veracity of theoretical assertions. Our review of the empirical literature suggests that selection-effects have received increasing attention in both micro- and macro-based research in recent years. Yet even when researchers acknowledge the issue, the techniques to correct for selection-effects have not always been employed in the proper manner; thus, estimations often suffer from shortcomings that potentially render flawed empirical findings. We explain the nature of self-selection based endogeneity bias and review the techniques available to researchers in management to correct for selection-effects when organizational decisions are discrete in nature. Furthermore, we engage in Monte Carlo simulations that demonstrate the tradeoffs involved with alternative techniques. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.',
 'This study aims to advance theoretical development regarding the double-edged sword effect of adaptation strategy on performance from the institutional theory and organizational learning theory perspectives. In particular, we examine the intermediate role of legitimacy and synergy to explain the different paths from marketing adaptation strategy to performance contingent on the environmental conditions of cultural distance. Data from a survey of 202 Chinese multinational corporations located in 24 different host countries are analyzed, and the results reveal that the effect of adaptation strategy on performance is positively mediated by legitimacy but negatively mediated by synergy. Meanwhile, the indirect effect of adaptation strategy on performance via legitimacy and synergy is also moderated by cultural distance such that both indirect effects are stronger in host countries with a high cultural distance. This study provides theoretical and managerial implications for adaptation strategy research. © 2021',
 "This article explores what factors drive digital platform firms to set or modify their boundaries. Building on economics, strategic management, and information systems research, I suggest that digital platforms make strategic decisions over three distinct types of interrelated boundaries: (1) the scope of the platform firm (what assets are owned, what labor is employed, and what activities are performed by the firm), (2) the configuration and composition of the platform's sides (which distinct groups of customers have access to the platform), and (3) the digital interfaces (that specify the 2-way exchange of data between the platform firm and each of its sides). In this article, I explore the interdependence between these seemingly separate decisions and the role of some important moderating variables. These moderators include whether the platform is a transaction or an innovation platform, and the extent to which the platform has developed from its initial formation stage. My work explains why we see so much variation in boundaries across platforms and over time. © 2020 The Author(s)",
 'In recent year, some scholars develop a new construct that they term “international digital competence” (IDC). A case study approach was used to analyze secondary data through the lens of internationalization strategies, dynamic capabilities, and platform management strategies. Four game platform companies were studied: Tencent Games, NetEase Games, Gamania, and WanIn International. The findings reveal that with abundant financial support and excellent talent teams, these companies leverage commercial development and strategic planning as dynamic capabilities, and adopt the strategy of mergers and acquisitions, or strategic alliances to enter the international market. Moreover, through novel commodity management thinking and cross-domain integration means, game platform companies leverage commodity IP operation and brand promotion as dynamic capabilities, and utilize existing IPs of major international game producers or develop their own exclusive IPs to promote their products in international markets. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explain the emergence of collaboration networks in entrepreneurial clusters as determined by the way entrepreneurs exchange knowledge and learn through business transactions needed to implement temporary supply chains in networks of co-located firms. Design/methodology/approach: A socio-computational approach is adopted to model business transactions and supply chain formation in Marshallian industrial districts (IDs). An agent-based model is presented and used as a virtual lab to test the hypotheses between the firms’ behaviour and the emergence of structural properties at the system level. Findings: The simulation findings and their validation based on the comparison with a real world cluster show that the topological properties of the emerging network are influenced by the learning strategies and decision-making criteria firms use when choosing partners. With reference to the specific case of Marshallian IDs it is shown that inertial learning based on history and past collaboration represents in the long term a major impediment for the emergence of hubs and of a network topology that is more conducive to innovation and growth. Research limitations/implications: The paper offers an alternative view of entrepreneurial learning (EL) as opposed to the dominant view in which learning occurs as a result of exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure). The results presented in this work show that adaptive, situated, and day-by-day learning has a profound impact on the performance of entrepreneurial clusters. These results are encouraging to motivate additional research in areas such as in modelling learning or in the application of the proposed approach to the analysis of other types of entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as start-up networks and makers’ communities. Practical implications: Agent-based model can support policymakers in identifying situated factors that can be leveraged to produce changes at the macro-level through the identification of suitable incentives and social networks re-engineering. Originality/value: The paper presents a novel perspective on EL and offers evidence that micro-learning strategies adopted and developed in routine business transactions do have an impact on firms’ performances (survival and growth) as well as on systemic performances related to the creation and diffusion of innovation in firms networks. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.',
 "Despite significant development, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China continue to experience institution-based barriers, especially in the area of innovation. What exactly are these barriers? How do these barriers influence innovation? How about the status quo of the institutional environment for SMEs' innovation and development? We seek to uncover these underexplored areas by developing a model characterized by a cost-risk-opportunity (CRO) innovation triangle. We then enrich this model by interviewing 82 top managers and owners at 41 SMEs. We identify the five key institution-based barriers to innovation in China: (1) competition fairness, (2) access to financing, (3) laws and regulations, (4) tax burden, and (5) support systems. These findings enhance the institution-based view of entrepreneurship by shedding light on how institution-based barriers affect innovation in SMEs. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

 "Prior research suggests that a high technology start-up's innovative capability and inter-firm network influence its performance and consequently, firm valuation. Few studies consider their joint influence and even fewer consider the temporal change of those effects on firm valuation. In this study, we propose that firm age, a key organizational variable, represents both the development of organizational routines from a start-up's perspective and the accumulation of accessible information from an investor's viewpoint. As such, an investor's evaluation of a high technology start-up's innovative capability and inter-firm network evolves with firm age. Using panel data of 170 biotechnology start-ups, our results suggest that the relative value of network status declines while the impact of innovative capability increases with firm age. Interestingly, there is a growing complementary effect of innovative capability and network heterogeneity on firm valuation. The implications of these findings for entrepreneurial practice and theories of firm capabilities and inter-firm network are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Realising corporate growth remains a challenging task for most firms. In this paper, we examine how multi-unit corporations can effectively coordinate the evolution of their growth initiatives. Based upon research on coordination, we identify four ideal modes that corporations can adopt as a means to dealing with their growth ambitions. We label these four: agenda-setting, context-setting, directing and self-organising. We show how these coordination modes represent different options for corporate management and have different implications for the role split between top managers and managers on subsequent levels. We illustrate them by using primary and secondary data from 51 corporations based in Europe, North America and Asia.

 "In accordance with the tenets of social capital theory, the knowledge-based view of the firm, and absorptive capacity theory we provide an integrative research model that sheds light on how suppliers can derive benefits from a strong relationship with key buyers. In particular, we examine three research questions that address: (i) the interrelationships among the three dimensions of buyer–supplier social capital (structural, cognitive, relational); (ii) the mechanism through which buyer–supplier social capital can influence supplier performance; and (iii) the contingency factors that influence the key relationships in the main model. We empirically validate the research model using data collected from a North America-based major electronic components distributor (i.e., the buyer) and 166 of its suppliers. The findings of our data analysis indicate that structural and cognitive social capital influence relational social capital. The findings also support that relational social capital allows for the transfer of knowledge from the buyer to the supplier, which in turn leads to greater supplier cost efficiency and innovation. However, the influence of buyer–supplier relational social capital appears to be less important in lengthier buyer–supplier relationships. The analysis also indicates that the benefits derived from a supplier's knowledge enrichment are significantly greater when the supplier possesses greater exploitative capacity. These findings provide important extensions to theory describing buyer–supplier relationships, as well as providing clear prescriptions for suppliers and relationship managers. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute",
 'Research summary: Entrepreneurial behavior is core to our understanding of entrepreneurship. Yet, research progress is hindered because most studies adopt a traditional perspective of the construct that is embedded in economic rationality and focused on for-profit ventures. Drawing on identity theory, we propose a reconceptualization that emphasizes the “identity relevance” of entrepreneurial behaviors, allows for different meanings that founders associate with entrepreneurship, and views founders as behaving in ways that they deem appropriate. Importantly, this perspective accounts for the behaviors not only of entrepreneurs who start ventures strictly out of economic self-interest, but also those who launch ventures because of concern for others—either in their community or in society at large. We elaborate on this argument and discuss ideas for future research. Managerial summary: We suggest that a concept of entrepreneurial behavior predicated on the purely rent-seeking entrepreneur ignores the increasing, and increasingly important, number of entrepreneurs who start enterprises for more than pure economic rent generation. Using identity theory permits us to parse modern entrepreneurs into three major types, namely the traditional seeker of rent, the entrepreneur who seeks to aid the community, and the entrepreneur who seeks to aid society at large. We show that using an identity perspective on entrepreneurial behavior allows us to explain very different economic and social outcomes by entrepreneur social identity type and posit the influence of entrepreneurial types in society on the evolution of a macroeconomic cycle.

 'Using an administrative payroll data set for 2.6 million retail workers, we find that the staggered rollout of a major e-commerce firm’s fulfillment centers reduces traditional retail workers’ income in geographically proximate counties by 2.4%. Wages of hourly workers, especially part-time hourly workers, decrease significantly driven by a drop in the number of hours worked. We observe a U-shaped pattern in which both young and old workers experience a sharper decrease in wage income. Consequently, some workers experience an increase in credit card delinquency. Using data for 3.2 million stores, we find that sales (employment) at proximate stores decrease by 4% (2.1%). Exits, especially of young and small stores, increase, and entry decreases. Our results highlight how creative destruction led by e-commerce impacts local labor markets. © 2023 INFORMS.',
 "When a company finds itself unable to execute strategy, all too often the first reaction is to redraw the organization chart or tinker with incentives. Far more effective would be to clarify decision rights and improve the flow of information both up the line of command and across the organization. Then, the right structures and motivators tend to fall into place. That conclusion is borne out by the authors' decades of experience as Booz & Company consultants and by the survey data that they have been collecting for almost five years from more than 125,000 employees of some 1,000 organizations in more than 50 countries. From this data they have distilled - and ranked in order of importance - the top 17 traits exhibited by the organizations that are most effective at executing strategy. The single most common attribute of such companies is that their employees are clear about which decisions and actions they are responsible for. As a result, decisions are rarely secondguessed, and accurate competitive information quickly finds its way up the hierarchy and across organizational boundaries. Managers communicate the key drivers of success, so frontline employees have the information they need to understand the impact of their day-to-day actions. Motivators - like performance appraisals that distinguish high, adequate, and low performers and rewards for fulfilling particular commitments - are also important but are most effective when applied after decision rights and information flows have been addressed. That holds true for structural moves as well. Surprisingly, the most effective structural moves turn out to be promoting people laterally - and more slowly. How can you make the most educated and cost-efficient decisions about which change initiatives to implement? The authors have developed a powerful online diagnostic and simulation tool that can help you test the effectiveness of various approaches virtually, without risking significant amounts of time and money.",
 "How does firm size impact on a firm's offshoring strategy? Are the underlying motives for offshoring, the particular functions considered, the locations to relocate, and the particular governance mode different for small, medium-sized and large firms? In this paper, cost, resource and entrepreneurial drivers are investigated for their relationship with firm size. Moreover, we hypothesize on the relationship between function, location and governance mode choices of offshoring and firm size. Using multi-country data of the Offshoring Research Network (ORN), we present empirical evidence on the three offshoring driver categories and function, location and governance mode choices of small, medium-sized and large firms. The results show offshoring might be used as cost, resource or entrepreneurial strategy. Cost drivers are most important for large and small firms, whereas resource drivers are especially important for medium-sized and large firms. Entrepreneurial drivers are most important for medium-sized firms, just like these firms have a relatively stronger preference for nearshoring. Small firms mostly offshore competence exploring activities, whereas large firms relocate competence exploiting activities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",
 "Due to the significant role of non-profit organizations in the development of modern societies, these organizations must adjust their boardrooms. Since traditional theories of corporate governance appear to be limited in explaining the changing non-profit world, we propose an extended model of governance that integrates the traditional arguments of agency theory with a cognitive dimension. Based on a sample of Spanish foundations, we present evidence on the effect of the board composition on foundations' organizational efficiency. We show that board size and independence do not have a definitive effect on the entity's efficiency. Instead, the knowledge diversity inside the boardroom and the active character of trustees have a positive influence on resource allocation. The cognitive dimension of the extended model of governance is critical to explaining how boards impact on organizational performance. © 2009 British Academy of Management.",
 "Social exchange theory is a broad theory that has been used to explain trust as an outcome of various exchange relationships, and research commonly presumes trust exists between exchange partners that have prior relationships. In this paper, we contribute to research on social exchange theory by isolating the trust outcomes of interorganizational exchanges from other outcomes emphasized by learning and knowledge-based perspectives, and by specifying important boundary conditions for the emergence of trust in interorganizational exchanges. We make such a theoretical contribution within the domain of strategic alliances by investigating the effects of previous alliance agreements, or prior ties, between the partnering firms. We find that prior ties generally lead to learning about a partner's anticipated behavioral patterns, which helps a firm predict when self-interested behavior may occur and know how to interact with the partner during the coordination and execution of the alliance tasks. By contrast, the kind of trust emphasized in social exchange theory is not generally rooted in prior ties and only emerges from prior relationships under certain conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on social exchange theory. © Academy of Management Journal.",
 'Crowdsourcing for innovation is typically conducted as an "innovation challenge." Despite the popularity of innovation challenges, there appears to be a growing consensus that innovation challenges do not succeed at generating solutions with competitive advantage potential. This article presents three ways in which managers can assure that their innovation challenges are fruitful: foster different crowd roles to encourage contribution diversity; offer knowledge integration instructions and dual incentives; and offer explicit instructions for sharing different types of knowledge. © 2014 by The Regents of the University of California.',
 'Strategy process and practice research has illuminated the internal dynamics of strategy work – at the cost of backgrounding processes and practices that relate to engagement with external actors. In this conceptual paper, we argue for an extension of this body of work by shifting the focus of research from internal practices and processes towards externally oriented practices of engagement. We do so by critically building on the military strategy literature and develop the concept of strategy as engagement. This concept suggests understanding the role of strategy as bridge between policy and tactics; the importance of grand strategy as the making of policy; and the need to focus attention on tactics as distributed collective action. Thus, we contribute to strategy process and practice research through 1) extending its repertoire to practices of engagement and 2) broadening its epistemic foundation through a critical reading of military strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',
 "What is the significance of Oliver Williamson's Nobel prize? This short article is an attempt to answer this question succinctly. First, he demonstrated when it is more efficient for a firm to make a component in-house rather than outsource it to another firm. Second, his work was path breaking because economic research at the time was largely fixated on market transactions and treated firms as black boxes of production. Williamson's work made economic scholars realize the need to analyze governance and incentives within and between firms in order to better understand how efficiency can be maintained in a capitalist society. Third, his original insights and the research area he pioneered - transaction costs economics - offer clear guidance for business strategy and public policy.",
 'Despite many studies investigating how lobbying expenditures enhance performance outcomes, limited attention has been given to understanding the underlying mechanisms driving firm lobbying behaviors—and, particularly, where firms target their lobbying expenditures. We argue lobbying breadth serves as a risk management strategy to both hedge against possible government intrusion and minimize disapproval of firm actions from government officials. As such, we posit firms’ strategic risk will positively relate to breadth of lobbying firms’ target. Further, if lobbying breadth serves as risk management strategy, then other aspects that affect decisions about the amount of risk protection a firm may need should also affect this relationship. We argue that CEOs’ ownership and firms’ political uncertainty may exacerbate exposure from firm risk taking to government actions, thus strengthening the insurance relationship. Similarly, we argue available slack, as a form of internal insurance against government actions, will weaken the relationship between strategic risk taking and lobbying breadth. We find support for most of our arguments in a sample of U. S. manufacturing firms. This research extends understanding of lobbying beyond the predominant focus on expenditures and securing beneficial outcomes. Exploring how lobbying breadth serves an important risk management role also offers insights into firm nonmarket strategy. © The Author(s) 2021.',
 'This paper first employs principal component analysis technique to develop and introduce an alternative UK corporate governance disclosure index to the US-centric ones. Second, we then investigate whether this new corporate governance disclosure index can determine the level of executive pay (including CEOs, CFOs, and all executive directors) in UK listed firms, and consequently ascertain whether the governance mechanisms can moderate the pay-for-performance sensitivity. Employing data on corporate governance, executive pay and performance from 2008 to 2013, we find that, on average, better-governed firms tend to pay their executives lower compared with their poorly-governed counterparts. Additionally, our findings suggest that the pay-for-performance sensitivity is generally positive, but improves in firms with high corporate governance quality, implying that the pay-for-performance sensitivity is contingent on the quality of internal governance structures. We interpret our findings within the predictions of optimal contracting theory and managerial power hypothesis. © 2018 European Academy of Management',
 'Commentators and academics now refer to Higher Education as a market and the language of the market frames and describes the sector. Considerable competition for students exists in the marketplace as institutions compete for students. Universities are aware of the importance of their reputations, but to what extent are they utilizing branding activity to deal with such competitive threats? Can institutions with lower reputational capital compete for students by increasing their brand presence? This study provides evidence from research into social media related branding activity and considers the impact of this activity, in particular social media interaction and social media validation, on student recruitment. The results demonstrate a positive effect for the use of social media on performance, especially when an institution attracts a large number of Likes on Facebook and Followers on Twitter. A particularly strong and positive effect results when universities use social media interactively. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.',
 "The lack of ability, knowledge, and resources at a national level leads companies to choose international strategic alliances (ISAs) as an appropriate solution to enter the global markets. In this regard, selecting appropriate partners is a fundamental step in reducing the risks and costs of these alliances. This article analyzes international partner selection scenarios using agent-based simulations in Iran's biopharmaceutical industry. In line with the goal of this research, a complete understanding of the failure and success of collaboration product innovation is presented. First, the critical/key success factors (KSFs) in international strategic alliances were identified through a literature review (LR) and screened via Fuzzy Delphi. Next, selected factors were weighted by fuzzy SWARA (Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and considered as simulation inputs for international partner selection. The simulation results indicated the critical role of the knowledge-matching degree and complementary resources and the insignificant impact of the company's reputation, government support, and experience in the international alliance. Furthermore, we found that pharmaceutical and biotech companies should emphasize their partner's complementary resources and develop an evaluation system to measure the knowledge-matching degree of their foreign partners in ISA. Eventually, this paper provides practical and applied solutions for biopharmaceutical industry managers to analyze business partners. The article also adds to the debate on ISAs in biopharmaceutical industries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Throughout its history, the legitimacy of the European Union has constantly been challenged. Eroding levels of political support have not left political elites unaffected. This article focuses on legitimation strategies formulated by the Commission between 1973 and 1994 and applies a post-structuralist framework to account for the development of legitimation strategies over time. The formulation of legitimation strategies becomes possible within distinct discourses while other plans of action to generate political support remain unthinkable. Narrative analysis is proposed as a useful methodological tool to analyze structures of meaning that restrain the Commission in its choice of legitimation strategies. © 2012 The Author(s) JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.',
 "Organizations following a replication strategy emphasize template leverage at the expenses of routine modification or routine generation. This issue is particularly important for organizations operating in dynamic environments, as these business contexts require organizations to engage in continuous renewal for their long-term success. We undertook a detailed investigation of middle managers' knowledge search routines in Gamma, a leading ICT multinational corporation (MNC), to unravel how the organizational context influences their search actions, solution development and routine development. We find that a flexible organizational structure, and not storing knowledge in central repositories, trigger knowledge search routines and mobilize diverse knowledge components for the architecture of new solutions. These findings contribute toward our understanding of micro-foundations of capability evolution in the context of a replication strategy, by uncovering the dual workings of organizational context elements in both enabling and challenging middle managers' knowledge search actions. It also extends our understanding of the role of middle managers in capability evolution by revealing the importance of architecture competences in developing solutions that renew routines, as well as the role of organizational context for the development of such competences. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",
 "Drawing on resource-advantage (R-A) theory, this paper examines the association between market orientation versus finance orientation and different potential CSR engagement motivations. It also examines if the different CSR motivations, in turn, are associated with differences in fiscal competitiveness and internal customer focus (employee morale). We analyze data from 257 companies. The results indicate that more market-oriented companies engage in CSR due to (a) ‘beneficence’ motivation (it's the right moral thing) and/or (b) ‘effectiveness’ related motivations (to generate employee goodwill, customer goodwill, and/or competitive advantage). The relationships are somewhat reversed for firms that are more finance-oriented—they are more focused on (a) effectiveness motivation and/or (b) efficiency motivation (everyone else is doing it, avoiding legislation, and/or rising energy costs), but not on (c) beneficence motivation. Last, beneficence and effectiveness motivations are associated with employee morale improvements, making these valuable internal marketing tools, while efficiency motivations are associated with fiscal competitiveness improvements. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
 'How will managerial perceptions concerning specific dimensions of legal system uncertainty affect wholly owned foreign subsidiary (WOFS) political tie intensity? This study employs the institution-based view of international business strategy to explore how managerial perceptions of specific dimensions of legal system uncertainty - ex-ante commercial law inadequacy and ex-post judicial arbitrariness - will act as determinants of WOFS political tie intensity. Our analysis of 181 WOFSs in the Philippines suggests that managerial perceptions of ex-ante commercial law inadequacy and ex-post judicial arbitrariness, being two distinct dimensions of legal system uncertainty, are determinants of political tie intensity. We also find that the positive association between managerial perceptions of ex-ante commercial law inadequacy and the intensification of political ties grows stronger when a WOFS is committed to organizational adaptation of capabilities to the local context, while the positive association between managerial perceptions of ex-post judicial arbitrariness and the intensification of political ties grows stronger when a WOFS is engaged in strategically positioning operations in an emerging market environment. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Although enlarging the audience base for the performing arts is necessary, little effort has been made to understand non-attendees in this industry. The current study focuses on non-attendees and aims to answer the following questions: (1) Why are non-attendees reluctant to attend the performing arts? (2) Whom, among them, should be targeted to be converted into attendees? To understand the reasons for non-attendance, we examined psychological factors (i.e., usage, risk and image barriers, and self-image congruence) as determinants of resistance. A survey of 672 non-attendees was conducted and a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis was applied to investigate the mechanism by which psychological factors formulate resistance and attendance intention. We also conducted a clustering analysis to detect heterogeneous sub-groups among non-attendees and suggested a target segment with the highest market potential. The findings of this study provide insights for the performing arts industry to create communication strategies specifically for non-attendees. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Major events in the private lives of CEOs have been a source of fascination for decades. However, despite gaining traction, studies on the relevant phenomena (e.g., marriage, divorce, parenthood, illness) remain scattered in parallel across disciplines. We thematically review the interdisciplinary evidence on the fast-emerging literature on CEO private life events (72 unique studies) to consolidate our understanding of how private life events can become reflected in the professional domains of CEO influence. Through this approach, we comprehensively intersect empirical progress on CEO life events with key strategic leadership outcomes (i.e., performance, strategy, socio-ethical issues, innovation, governance), allowing us to identify key gaps and highlight inconsistencies. We then propose several research opportunities and challenges to move the field from phenomenon-driven standalone studies to a more coherent research program on the blurred boundaries between the private and professional lives of CEOs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.',

 "In recent years, there has been strong interest in leaders' exploration and exploitation activities, especially because of their positive effects on performance. Most prior research in this area has focused on the organizational antecedents of leaders' exploration and exploitation activities, with less consideration given to the psychological precursors. This paper draws upon insights from the behavioral strategy literature to inform our theoretical perspective on leaders' exploration-exploitation activities. In particular, by conceptually linking leaders' regulatory focus and exploration-exploitation, we provide a theoretical framework to explain these activities from a psychological viewpoint. Moreover, we employ two moderator variables to better understand the different properties and boundaries of this framework. All in all, this paper has a number of implications for strategic leadership theory and practice. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",
 'The current article notes that the standard application of relative importance analyses is not appropriate when examining the relative importance of interactive or other higher order effects (e.g., quadratic, cubic). Although there is a growing demand for strategies that could be used to decompose the predicted variance in regression models containing such effects, there has been no formal, systematic discussion of whether it is appropriate to use relative importance statistics in such decompositions, and if it is appropriate, how to go about doing so. The purpose of this article is to address this gap in the literature by describing three different yet related strategies for decomposing variance in higher-order multiple regression models-hierarchical F tests (a between-sets test), constrained relative importance analysis (a within-sets test), and residualized relative importance analysis (a between- and within-sets test). Using a previously published data set, we illustrate the different types of inferences these three strategies permit researchers to draw. We conclude with recommendations for researchers seeking to decompose the predicted variance in regression models testing higher order effects. © The Author(s) 2013.',
 'There is a major debate regarding the role of concentrated family ownership and control in large firms, with three positions suggesting that such concentration is (1) good, (2) bad, or (3) irrelevant for firm value. Why are there such differences? We theorize that the impact of family ownership and control on firm value is associated with the level of shareholder protection embodied in legal and regulatory institutions of a country. Data from 634 publicly listed large family firms in seven Asian countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) are used to test our hypotheses. Overall, this article sketches the contours of a cross-country, institution-based view of corporate governance, and leads to a more informed understanding of the crucial role of institutions behind family ownership and control in large firms. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.',
 "Integrating Hobfoll's (1989) conservation of resources theory with Berry's (1997) acculturation taxonomies, we develop a typological theory to explain the acculturation stress and adaptation processes of domestic employees in the context of globalization. From a resource-based perspective, we first identify four resources-social dominance, ethnocentric orientation, social capital, and absorptive capacity-that represent Hobfoll's four kinds of resources (i.e., object, personal, condition, and energy) and differentiate them in terms of their goal (i.e., maintaining the original culture or seeking intercultural interactions) and orientation (i.e., individual or social). We postulate that domestic employees' loss and gain of these resources set boundary conditions for acculturation stress in response to the influence of globalization. Then, drawing on Berry's taxonomies, we configure different combinations of the loss and gain of these resources to form individual and collective ideal types of resources that set boundary conditions for the influence of acculturation stress on adaptation approaches (i.e., integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) at the individual level and the influence of globalization on adaptation cultures (i.e., multiculturalism, melting pot, segregation, and exclusion) at the organizational level. Finally, we propose that adaptation cultures exert influences on domestic employees' normative freedom of choice of adaptation approaches.  © Academy of Management Review.",

 'Emerging multinational enterprises (EMNEs) often engage in strategic-asset-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) for competitive catch-up. This study explores the linkages between an EMNE’s competitive scenario consisting of a configuration of its awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) conditions and the comparative institutional advantages of its strategic-asset-seeking destination. Our configurational analyses of Chinese FDIs in the technology-intensive industries of OECD countries reveal a taxonomy of four distinct asset-seeking strategies of EMNEs. Our findings shed novel insights into the strategic variations within EMNEs based on a theoretically and methodologically extended AMC framework.

 'This study examines insider lobbying as a form of relational Corporate Political Activity (CPA) that can be used by firms to gain an advantage in the competition for government contracts, and how firm size moderates the effectiveness of different insider lobbying strategies. Drawing on a unique dataset that captures meetings between private companies and British government ministers, we find that both the breadth and depth of insider lobbying are positively related to the value of the contracts awarded by the UK Ministry of Defence. Further analysis reveals that the benefits from a strategy of lobbying depth are stronger for small firms, than those from a strategy of lobbying breadth. The findings suggest that the bridging and bonding social capital cultivated through meetings with politicians can be deployed in alternative ways by different-sized firms. © 2021 European Academy of Management (EURAM).',
 'This study addresses the lack of research into social processes of competition in organizations and explores women leaders self-positioning in relation to the discourses of gendered competition and neoliberal competition. The discourses carry contradictory obligations for women. While the gendered competition discourse socially punishes competitive women, the neoliberal competition discourse expects competition. Through a feminist approach and critical discourse analysis of narratives from 52 women leaders we make two central contributions. First, we outline how the two discourses jostle together, fighting for attention and contradicting each other, provoking social ambiguity. We demonstrate how the women leaders adopt paradoxical self-positioning as ‘competitive–not competitive’ using four interconnected strategies of ‘denying’, ‘masking and reframing’, ‘moving on’ from and ‘diverting’ competition. Second, we extend studies of liminality and theorize how the discourses create liminality for women leaders. We elucidate how the women take up and disrupt the discourses by continually oscillating between paradoxical positions of being competitive, perceived as competitive, not competitive, no longer competitive, and competitive for organizations. Competition is identified as a toxic, gendered process, which is both harmful and aspirational, and both a liminal challenge and an opportunity for women leaders. We extend understandings of those who experience liminality in organizations, to women leaders and demonstrate how their paradoxical self-positioning affords them opportunities to discursively present as competitive. © The Author(s) 2024.',

 "Brand research increasingly recognizes the active role of multiple stakeholders in co-creating brand meaning and the importance of new social media supporting stakeholders in their co-creation efforts. However, empirical insights into the social process of online multi-stakeholder brand meaning co-creation are so far missing. This study contributes to existing research by illuminating the social dynamics that characterize multi-stakeholder brand meaning co-creation in a virtual environment. The authors undertake an online discursive inquiry focusing on stakeholders' textual interactions regarding the UK Gate Gourmet brand crisis. The empirical study aggregates online stakeholder texts to illustrate (a) relationships between salient stakeholders and (b) discursive strategies and resources stakeholders apply to co-create brand meaning.

 "This paper is a theory development to Amit, Brander, and Zott (1998, Journal of Business Venturing, 13: 441-466) on the nature of venture capital firms. In their paper, the authors argue that venture capital firms exist because they fill a market niche by developing the ability to overcome extreme information asymmetry embedded in high-risk entrepreneurial firms. However, this theory encounters difficulties in explaining a variety of organizational and behavioral divides among venture capitalists in different contexts and over time. In this paper, we apply the institution-based view to reveal the nature of venture capital. We argue that it is the venture capitalists' capability to capture economic rents from the institutional environment that distinguish them from other financial intermediaries. We show the connection of our perspective with the conventional view as well as the usefulness of this theory in explaining the development of the venture capital industry in China. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

 'Research has shown that offshore outsourcing processes may influence the behavior and strategic choices of firms, but little is known about the determining factors that influence the evolution and outcomes of those processes. Furthermore, longitudinal studies able to generate such insights are lacking. This paper suggests a detailed, activity-based approach to the study of the process of offshore outsourcing of high-value, advanced service activities. While earlier research has considered either firm-internal or firm-external sources of resource building, this study offers a more comprehensive theoretical model that combines resource-based theory and international business network theory. It aims to investigate how determinants of the offshore outsourcing process contribute to the resource stocks of client firms. Based on two longitudinal case studies of offshore outsourcing to India, the study finds that offshore outsourcing operations, in general, make positive contributions to the resource stocks of client firms. Some determinants contribute to the building of resources (partnership commitment decisions, knowledge creation and learning, trust building, the interconnectedness of resources) while others impede resource building (time compression diseconomies, lack of resource mass efficiencies). Notably, the interconnectedness among onshore activities, offshore activities and the underpinning knowledge resources reduces the risk of erosion of client firm resources, although this remains a long-term risk. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.',
 'This study develops and tests a theoretical framework which suggests interactive dynamics, with strong performance implications, between the height of mobility barriers surrounding strategic groups and the extent of within-group multimarket competition. Empirical analysis drawn from a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms indicates that within-group multimarket competition has strong positive effect on firm performance for strategic groups surrounded by high mobility barriers. As we move lower on the mobility barriers hierarchy, this effect decreases, becoming non-significant for groups surrounded by moderate mobility barriers and negative for groups surrounded by low mobility barriers. These findings highlight the conditions under which mobility barriers and multimarket competition have significant performance implications. In addition, our results suggest that mobility barriers and multimarket competition are not substitutive but complementary devices promoting mutual coordination within strategic groups. Finally, our findings point to the need to consider multimarket contacts as an aggregate property of strategic groups. © 2010 The Authors.

 'Developing the "right" new products is critical to firm success and is often cited as a key competitive dimension. This paper explores new product development (NPD) portfolio strategy and the balance between incremental and radical innovation. We characterize innovative effort through a normative theoretical framework that addresses a popular practice in NPD portfolio management: the use of strategic buckets. Strategic buckets encourage the division of the overall NPD resource budget into smaller, more focused budgets that are defined by the type of innovative effort (incremental or radical). We show that time commitment determines the balance between incremental and radical innovation. When managers execute this balance, they are often confounded by (i) environmental complexity, defined as the number of unknown interdependencies among technology and market parameters that determine product performance; and (ii) environmental instability, the probability of changes to the underlying performance functions. Although both of these factors confound managers, we find that they have completely opposite effects on the NPD portfolio balance. Environmental complexity shifts the balance toward radical innovation. Conversely, environmental instability shifts the balance toward incremental innovation. Risk considerations and implications for theory and practice are also discussed © 2008 INFORMS.',
 "Companies throughout industry are interested in retaining existing customers, because customers' continuous consumption of products and services is critical to the long-term value propositions of most organizations. Thus, decision-making strategies that promote continuous use and customer retention are of research interest, both theoretically and practically. In the present research, we investigate one important area of continuous usage, that of Web site use. In particular, we use several theories of commitment to understand how an individual's decision to continue to use a Web site is influenced by his or her commitment toward that Web site and the vendor that supports it. Results derived from data collected from 335 users of a variety of Web sites indicated that affective commitment, calculative commitment, quality of alternatives, and trust were significantly associated with an individual's behavioral intention to continue to use a Web site.

 "This exploratory study is intended to analyze how a combination of the resources-based view and agency theory can provide a better understanding of the internal dynamic of the family business and its evolution. Our evidence seems to suggest that the desire to keep family control produces specific sources of value and conditions the firm's financial capacity to acquire resources. These peculiarities change between first and following generations. During the first generation, we find that less severe agency costs balance the negative effect of scarce financial structure on the family firm's value. After descendants join the firm, the increasing agency costs are compensated by the enlargement of the firm's financial structure. © 2007 Family Firm Institute, Inc.",
 'In this essay, we study the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from the theoretical perspective of the “rhizome” coined by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. We understand organizing in general and conflict emergence in particular through the becoming of the rhizomatic ontology of organizing. In our view, the emergence of organizing is a manifestation of a rhizomatic basis of things, seen in nomadic strategies of pursuing revolutionary aims and resisting power hegemonies. We discuss how armed resistance groups relate to time and duration, and their stark contrast to Western professional, expeditionary armies operating in a clearly defined space and time. We complement the established philosophical and organizing-theoretical approaches to being and becoming in understanding conflict emergence with the rhizomatic perspective. We conclude our essay by discussing both theoretical and practical implications for understanding and managing conflict. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.',
 'The study is theoretically grounded in the resource-based view and applied to a service industry-tourism. It examined the performance of small ventures by utilizing an integrated dynamic model of entrepreneur choices and resource accumulation. Each phase in the process is added to previous one. Findings from 305 small tourism ventures revealed that the human capital of the entrepreneur, particularly managerial skills, were the greatest contributing factor to performance. This was followed by venture type. The study illustrates the unique nature of the entrepreneurial process among small ventures, often defined as "lifestyle businesses". © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

 'Research on prosocial entrepreneurship so far has focused either on ex-ante motives to create prosocial enterprises or on ex-post strategies to protect mission orientation. Surprisingly little is known about the prosocial entrepreneurial competences that help acquire resources to create blended value once a venture has been established. To fill this gap, this article presents a qualitative study in an Indian setting that shows how prosocial entrepreneurs adopt three types of competences to assemble resources when they establish their ventures. © The Regents of the University of California 2022.',
 "We characterize the effect of anticipated regret on consumer decisions and on firm profits and policies in an advance selling context where buyers have uncertain valuations. Advance purchases trigger action regret if valuations turn out to be lower than the price paid, whereas delaying purchase may cause inaction regret from missing a discount or facing a stockout. Consumers whom we describe as emotionally rational act strategically in response to the firm's policies and in anticipation of regret. In this context, regret explains two types of behavioral patterns: inertia (delayed purchase) and frenzies (buying early at negative surplus). We show how firms should optimally respond to consumer regret and also characterize a normative regret threshold above which they should not advance sell. Action regret reduces profits as well as the value of advance selling and booking limit policies for price-setting firms; inaction regret has the opposite effects. These effects are diminished by capacity constraints and are reversed for firms facing price pressure in the advance period (owing, e.g., to competition or market heterogeneity). Regret heterogeneity explains premium advance selling for the capacity-constrained firm, which may benefit from larger shares of regretful buyers. Finally, we show how the negative effects of regret on profits can be mitigated by regret-priming marketing campaigns and by offering refunds or options or allowing resales. Our results highlight the importance of assessing the relative strength of regret within and across market segments and of accounting for these factors in pricing and marketing policies. © 2012 INFORMS.",
 'This article discusses four standardization and adaptation strategies. Two strategies foster adaptation: one by submission, and the other by indifference. The other two strategies foster standardization: one by superiority and the other by disputable standardization. The study focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because SME internationalization is the current trend in international business research. Interviews with entrepreneurs gather information on how entrepreneurs balance adaptation and standardization. The study shows that three main factors influence adaptation and standardization strategies: business activity, international business experience, and personal values. Results reveal a new dimension, namely customers relations, which scholars should consider in future research on adaptation and standardization. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.',
 "Although most prior literature on the strategic value of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments has focused solely on its role as an explorative learning method, in reality, many corporate investors are also using CVC investments for exploitative learning to strengthen their existing business model. In this study, we focus on the operational aspects of CVC investments and discuss how the explorative and exploitative innovation performance of corporate investors is affected by the level of the structural autonomy granted to their CVC dedicated unit. Using 20 years of panel data from 77 corporate investors in U.S. high-tech industries, we find that the structural autonomy of the CVC unit exhibits a positive relationship with the corporate investor's explorative innovation performance, while it is negatively related with exploitative innovation performance. © 2018",
 'Research Summary: The impact of post-entry internationalization speed (PIS) on firm performance has become a central issue in global strategy research. This paper conducts a meta-analysis concerning the relationships between two dimensions (i.e., international commitment speed and international scope speed) of PIS and performance, and the moderating effects of learning speed on these relationships among international firms. Empirical evidence from 60 independent samples reveals that international commitment speed positively influences performance, while international scope speed has an inverted U-shaped impact on performance. Our results also indicate that learning speed negatively moderates the link between international commitment speed and performance, whereas it positively moderates the association between international scope speed and performance. Based on the findings, we discuss the contributions to the global strategy literature, organizational learning theory and time-based competition view, and point at future research directions systematically. Managerial Summary: We analyze the relationships between two types (i.e., international commitment speed and international scope speed) of post-entry internationalization speed (PIS) and performance among international firms. We find that accelerating international commitment speed facilitates performance, while expediting international scope speed first facilitates and then inhibits performance. We also find that learning speed weakens the positive influence of international commitment speed on performance, whereas it strengthens the association between international scope speed and performance. These findings have important implications for managers in international firms seeking to achieve superior firm performance. © 2022 Strategic Management Society.',
 "'Partnership' is a buzzword for agents delivering policy solutions, funding and implementation strategies for effective international development. We call such an ensemble of policies and practices the 'partnership discourse'. We explore the value of the term 'partnership' in international development with an empirical focus on the African context and issues of equality in relations between international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are routinely characterized as partnerships. The results of our research in Uganda indicate that a hiatus exists between the rhetoric and reality of such partnerships. Partnerships on the ground reproduce relations of inequality characterized by subordination and oppression. The retroductive explanation we offer for such an emergent picture is to recast partnerships not as neutral management tools, but as political processes actualized in a terrain that is contested and uneven. Our theoretical contribution is to develop a political theorization of inter-organizational relations that allows us to explore the social consequences, specifically on inequality, associated with the partnership discourse. Our substantive contribution is to elaborate the value of the term 'partnership' in the international development domain. Its value is to smooth over antagonism and co-opt dissent by proposing a solution to effective development that is both ethically and managerially good. © The Author(s) 2014.",
 'While all multinational organizations face the challenge of managing tensions between local integration and global responsiveness, they are increasingly required to pursue additional, often paradoxical, objectives – such as social and commercial goals. However, we know little about how these tensions at the core of the MNC strategy interact. Based on an inductive qualitative study of four headquarters–subsidiary relationships in a Latin American Multinational Hybrid Organization, we develop a model showing the interplay of multiple tensions and management approaches to address them. This allows us to contribute to research on subsidiary roles, which we found to differ depending on how multiple tensions are addressed. Furthermore, we add to the literature on hybridity in multinational organizations by pointing out how regional differences between units of a single organization unfold. Finally, we provide some practical recommendations for the management of multinational hybrid organizations. © 2020, The Author(s).',
 'This paper analyzes the market penetration and expansion strategy of cosmetics and toiletries multinational enterprises (MNEs) in South Korea from the perspective of regional strategy as developed recently by Rugman. We find that MNEs have different market entry and expansion strategies in the home region and in the foreign region. Home region MNEs (Japanese MNEs in this case), in general, utilize their firm-specific advantages (FSAs) better than foreign region MNEs (European and MNEs from the Americas in this case). Due to differences in transaction costs, home region MNEs exploit downstream FSAs while foreign region MNEs develop upstream FSAs. Market similarity also leads to a greater incentive to operate in the home region rather than in foreign regions. The home region effect significantly increases the likelihood of entry into foreign markets as the host country\'s "diamond" significantly affects the market entry strategies of MNEs. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.',
 'Recent analysis of family firm internationalization has shown that international performance can suffer when family owners or managers engage in an unwarranted, strict separation between two ‘generic categories’ of resources in their strategic decision-making. On the one hand, there are resources perceived as ‘being part of the family in the long run’, and therefore unique and worthy of nurturing. On the other hand, there are resources perceived as ‘with the family only for the short run’, and therefore having commodity-type status and being fungible. The concept of bifurcation bias describes this frequently observed, affect-based phenomenon of separating all resources utilized by the firm into two categories. Bifurcation bias has been argued to be particularly damaging in the context of internationalization, whereby accurate assessment and complex recombination of resources is critical. In this paper, we extend the analysis of bifurcation bias in family firms. We examine how the personal values of family firm owners and non-family members, as well as the dominant cultural values in the relevant, surrounding societies (both home and host), can influence the magnitude and dysfunctional effects of this phenomenon. Infusing values-based analysis into assessing how bifurcation bias plays out in family firms, can improve our understanding of family firm heterogeneity, has implications for empirical research, and may help invalidate some overgeneralized narratives in research on family-firm international behaviour. © 2019, The Author(s).',
 "In today's disruptive world, firms and supply chains are facing massive disruptions, primarily owing to resource scarcity. We develop a model supported by the resilience and resource-based theories to assess supply chain decision-makers in the United States. We validate the model by employing partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. We find that supply chain agility and flexibility can support supply chain resilience, which in turn sustains supply chain performance. Furthermore, we find a mediation effect of supply chain resilience in the relationship between agility and supply chain performance, as well as between flexibility and supply chain performance. Furthermore, the findings suggest that supply chain performance under severe disruptions can be achieved when supply chains are resilient based on the combination of agility and flexibility. Our study contributes to the supply chain resilience and resource-based theory literature by identifying that resource configuration plays a decisive role in resilience and performance in severe disruptions due to resource scarcity. Our findings suggest that not all resilience-related resources are necessary to build resilience and support performance. Therefore, when confronted by a disruptive crisis, managers, practitioners and policymakers should identify the best resource configurations to create resilience and support performance. © 2023 British Academy of Management.",
 'We investigate how the four dimensions of the dynamic capabilities (DC) construct (sensing, learning, integrating, and coordinating) individually affect firm performance and the moderating role of market orientation (MO) in the process. Our findings, based on a sample of 509 Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), suggest that not all DC dimensions are equally important for SME performance. We further found MO to significantly moderate the relationships between both the sensing capability and the learning capability and firm performance.

 "Translating a diverse body of research, including industrial organization economics, strategy, and entrepreneurship, we present a framework of micro entry-specifically, how de novo entrants penetrate markets dominated by large incumbents without intensifying rivalry. Entrant-incumbent relations has received substantial attention in these three literatures, but with a few exceptions, prior research has focused mainly on hostile entry and on large or comparable players. We explain, however, that acute size differences create distinct entrant-incumbent dynamics. Normatively, we show how, when, and where micro entrants are most likely to penetrate markets dominated by large incumbents. Conceptually, we expand resource partitioning and mutual forbearance theories by relaxing their assumptions and then remeshing their logic, thus offering nuanced insights on entrant-incumbent relations when size differences are very large. Contrary to the creative-destructive hypothesis, we evince that market penetration is more likely when micro entrants either solidify large incumbents' positions or target small niches that are inconsequential for large incumbents. Reactions to micro entry are also influenced by contextual factors- when large incumbents operate in value networks that expand through integration or modularity.",
 "Jung's (2009) paintings of his dreams to enable conscious interpretation of his conversations within the collective unconscious informs a call for creating visual narrative art to inform meanings of personal and collective unconscious relating to stories consumers tell about buying and using brands. This study describes 13 conversations relevant to the study of conscious and the collective unconscious for consumer-brand relationships/communications. The 13 conversations' paradigm is useful for complementing the dominant logic by scholars of asking questions and relying on consumer conscious interpretations in their responses. The article advocates the use of multiple methods for both collecting and interpreting consumer-brand relationships, and illustrates the usage of storyboard-art of consumer-brand relationships in natural contexts. Brand strategy implications focus on the value of identifying how brands enable consumers to enact primal forces (archetypes). © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",
 "For established firms, radical growth requires experimenting with new alternatives, which can test the boundaries of management's thinking. This study proposes that entrepreneurial perceptions of the strategic situation and market environment have a direct influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) strategy, which is strategy that supports new business development and renewal. The results indicate that strategy makers will pursue a more explorative CE strategy in situations framed as positive, less controllable and yet knowable, and in environments perceived as munificent and dynamic. Additionally, with explorative CE strategy comes a greater investment in radical growth (i.e., new lines of business). The paper concludes with a discussion of the study's implications in regards to the relationship between interpretation and strategy and the management of attention and meaning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",
 "This study examined how top management team's (TMT) international orientation influences perceptions of environmental uncertainty and how these perceptions impact international strategic decisions, in particular regarding ownership stakes taken in foreign acquisitions. We highlighted the need for the concept of TMT international orientation to encompass executives' formative-years' international experiences along with their international career experiences and nationalities. Empirical tests based on a sample of 2122 international acquisitions completed by 561 UK firms over the period 1999-2008 showed that TMT international orientation positively moderated the negative impact of cultural differences and host country risk on acquisition ownership stakes. The results underscored the importance of considering decision-makers' attributes due to their experiences at a young age, beyond their demographic characteristics or professional experience, in the context of international strategic choices. We also discussed some implications of one of the possible consequences of executives' formative international experience, namely biculturalism, for international business. © 2012 British Academy of Management.",
 "In this study, we contend that the corporate spin-off's entrance into a market is strongly conditioned by a strategic logic tied to its legacy history. Unencumbered by this logic, de novo entrants have at least two potential advantages. They learn differently, and they do not face the challenge of unlearning. We test our hypotheses in the context of a major shift in rules for drug approval in the pharmaceutical industry. The results show de novo entrants choose market options that were less connected to past decisions, while entrants with a tie to legacy firms shift less from their initial position. In addition, de novo entrants entered market areas that were less densely populated, as compared to corporate spin-off entrants, which is evidence of a tendency for de novo entrants to avoid direct competition while corporate spin-offs seek legitimacy through mimicry. © 2016 International Council for Small Business",
 'This research aims to analyse whether a sustainable strategy brings efficiency to the luxury sector in the fight against carbon footprint. Such an aim has been approached by establishing a relationship between the actions implemented in the sector, the carbon footprint as measured by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology, and the market share of the main market operators. The results reveal which actions tend to be efficient in terms of carbon footprint fight, which actions do not, and how concentration or dispersion of main operators has impacted the global carbon footprint in the sector. Consequently, this work explores specific actions that luxury companies take to be economically efficient in their business strategy and to protect the environment. Finally, companies must be efficient and sustainable to contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda. © 2022 The Author(s)',
 "Today's marketplaces are increasingly multicultural as more individuals negotiate complex cultural identities. Brands play a role in materializing individual identities-however, little is known about how culture-based brand appeals might affect consumers' identity dynamics, positively or negatively. The paper provides a framework and a model that examines the interaction between three different types of multicultural marketplaces (assimilation, separation, and mutual integration) and different voices that brands might use in their cultural appeals (Branding Ignorance, Branding Tolerance, and Branding Engagement). The model identifies how these different voices (strategies) might exacerbate consumer vulnerabilities in different types of marketplaces and provides recommendations for how to use culture-based branding appeals in a benevolent manner. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",
 "Using computer simulation, we investigate the impact of different strategies on the financial performance of VCs. We compare simple heuristics such as equal weighting and fast and frugal trees with more complex machine learning and regression models and analyze the impact of three factors: VC learning, the statistical properties of the investment environment, and the amount of information available in a business plan. We demonstrate that the performance of decision strategies and the relative quality of decision outcomes change critically between environments in which different statistical relationships hold between information contained in business plans and the likelihood of financial success. The Equal Weighting strategy is competitive with more complex investment decision strategies and its performance is robust across environments. Learning only from those plans that the simulated VC invested in, drastically reduces the VC's potential to learn from experience. Lastly, the results confirm that decision strategies differ in respect to the impact of added information on the outcomes of decisions. Finally, we discuss real-world implications for the practice of VCs and research on VC decision making. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",
 "The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of a firm's strategy to invest in a conflict location. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been done before. We examine this using a standard model of international business, overlaid with the fundamental approach to corporate social responsibility. We start with the population of multinationals who have chosen to invest in low income countries with weak institutions. We then split this sample in order to distinguish between firms that have invested in conflict regions compared to those that have not. Our analysis then proceeds to explain the decision of those firms to invest in conflict locations using a simple Probit model. We find that countries with weaker institutions and less concern about corporate social responsibility (CSR) are more likely to invest in conflict regions. Finally, firms with more concentrated ownership are more likely to invest in such locations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",
 "This study contends that the association between corporate cash holdings and corporate governance is subject to the investment environments that firms face. For example, firms with an abundance of investment opportunities have a strong incentive to hold cash in order to maintain their competitive positions. Shareholders accept high levels of cash holdings in such growing firms if corporate governance can protect their interests. This study examines the effects of corporate governance on cash holdings for a sample of high-tech firms. The results show that CEO ownership, the directorship of venture capitalists (VCs), and independent directors play critical roles in corporate cash policy. In addition, the boards are more effective when the firms' CEOs are also their founders or when VCs hold a large stake of company shares. The effects of corporate governance are more significant in younger firms while the effects of firm-specific economic variables are more significant in older firms in the sample. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

 'This paper provides a theoretical model of the trade-offs that an MNE faces when organising its R&D as decentralised or centralised. R&D decentralisation avoids having to adapt centrally developed innovations to local markets, being able to use the specific know-how of the subsidiary. In addition R&D subsidiaries can be used to source locally available external know-how. At the same time, however, R&D internationalisation intensifies the spillover of valuable know-how to competitors located in the foreign markets. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the intensity of competition in the local market in determining the size of both the benefits and costs of R&D decentralisation. It shows that when R&D is undertaken abroad in association with production, the local knowledge base is not unequivocally a pulling factor attracting R&D investments by foreign MNEs, depending on the level of local competition. The paper also shows that efficiency in reverse intra-company technology transfers is a critical factor in benefiting from technology sourcing. The results thus illustrate the complementarity of efficient internal and external knowledge management systems. In addition the model suggests that, with a fall in the cost of intra-company technology transfers, relative market size loses importance as a locational factor for R&D decentralisation. © 2007 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.',
 'This paper explores the complex processes of identity construction of female ethnic minority entrepreneurs. Informed by discursive approaches to identity, we make an intersectional analysis of five life stories of female entrepreneurs of Moroccan or Turkish origin in the Netherlands. Being female, Turkish or Moroccan, and entrepreneur at the same time requires various strategies to negotiate identities with different constituencies. These strategies of identity work vary in the degree of conformity: one type is to mainly adhere to conventional images of femininity, a second one is to denounce femininity and/or ethnicity situationally, and the third is to resist the masculine connotation of entrepreneurship by disconnecting it from masculinity. Our focus on this hitherto neglected group of entrepreneurs makes for a situated contribution to the deconstruction of the entrepreneurial archetype of the white male hero. It furthers the understanding of the micropolitics of identity construction in the workplace in relation to the social categories of gender, ethnicity and entrepreneurship.

 "Purpose: This paper analyzes the importance given by venture capital (VC) firms to the different characteristics of the patent portfolio of a young innovative company (YIC). In an attempt to go beyond previous studies, the authors argue that not only is the size of a technological portfolio significant but also its nature. It is also examined whether the correlation between patents and VC financing varies across different industrial sectors and over different rounds of VC investments. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis has focused on a sample of 1,096 European YICs between the years 2010 and 2014. Target companies were identified in the monthly bulletins of Go4Venture, which reported the largest European deals and gathered information on the amount of VC financing. Additional data was derived from FinSMEs and crunchbase. Industrial sectors were differentiated according to their ability to appropriate the returns of innovation by relying on patent protection mechanisms. A multivariate regression framework at the patent family level was adopted to investigate empirical associations between the amount of VC financing and the characteristics of a YIC's patent portfolio. Findings: The results confirm the positive value of patents. Both the size and the characteristics of a YIC patent portfolio have been found to be positively associated with the total amount of VC financing. Additionally, the correlation between a YIC patent portfolio and VC investment varies across industries and over rounds of funding. Although the number of patents is positively correlated with VC investments in sectors with strong Intellectual Property (IP) regimes, the same does not apply to sectors characterized by lower patent intensity, where qualitative metrics seem to have a stronger correlation. Significant differences have also been found for the different rounds of VC investments. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper are related to data availability. Empirical associations have been investigated, but causal effects cannot be ascertained in this framework. The authors focused on a sample of firms that received VC funding. Several transactions were excluded, due to a lack of specifications pertaining to the round series. Furthermore, a number of potential drivers of the financed amounts, such as variables related to the founder or the management team, have not been considered in this study. Practical implications: For firms operating in sectors with weak IP regimes, patents are positively associated with attracting equity capital, if they are the output of R&D collaborations and have higher technical merit. In industries where patent intensity is higher, patent portfolio size matters more than quality. This suggests that VC investors award innovation quality to cases in which patenting is less frequent. Since the results indicate that positive associations between patenting and VC financing are more significant in later stages, managers should plan their patenting strategy in advance to reap the related benefits, and then collect the premium at later VC stages. Originality/value: In this paper, the importance given by VC firms to different characteristics of a YIC patent portfolio has been analyzed in terms of size, quality, and complexity. While previous empirical analyses mainly focused on a single sector, the authors have examined whether the relevance of patents for VC financing decisions varies across industries and over different rounds of investment. The geographical coverage of the sample is another novelty of the paper. Previous works focused on a limited number of countries, whereas this research has considered firms operating in several European countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
 'This research deals with the possibility that luxury purchasing among older consumers is related to their cognitive age (i.e., the age they feel) and, accordingly, the study reported herein assesses the effects of the underlying luxury motives on cognitive age. Results show that older consumers who relate luxury goods purchasing mainly to status reasons tend to feel younger than those who consider luxury goods purchasing primarily as a means to express their individual style. Furthermore, the study finds that, in order to meet their needs and wants, older consumers with a lower cognitive age rely more on brands than specific products; so their luxury goods purchasing intention is influenced more by brand images than product characteristics. These findings have marketing implications in the context of planning ad hoc advertising strategies aimed at luxury selling to older consumers. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.',
 "There has been little exploration of the competition arising from low-cost countries' imports to the home markets of multinational enterprises (MNEs) headquartered in developed countries. This study presents theoretical and empirical analyses of the level of future MNE activities in LCCs due to the rising prevalence of LCC imports in the MNEs' home markets. Building upon oligopolistic parallel behavior theory, we analyze the impact of LCC competition intensity and LCC product quality. We test the model using data collected from a top management survey of 423 U. S. and German manufacturing firms. The intensity of competition from LCCs and the quality of products imported from LCCs significantly explain MNEs' subsequent responses to that competition. Cross-country comparisons show that while LCC product quality is important in both samples, the intensity of competition from LCCs is significant for MNEs' future activities in LCCs only in the U. S. sample. A stronger prior orientation toward LCCs and low logistics costs also lead to higher levels of future MNE activities in LCCs, while technological progress does not. © 2010 Gabler-Verlag.",
 "Prior research has demonstrated the role of gender in recruitment and selection processes. We contribute to this literature by moving beyond studying persisting barriers for women and exploring collective practices that can contribute to gender equality. Drawing on in-depth case studies of recent appointments to corporate boards in the Netherlands, we examine the role of multiple actors and their collective strategies and dynamic interactions. This way, we provide a better understanding of the possibilities of multiple actors to bring about change or reinforce the status quo. Our findings reveal, first, that a group of ‘moderate change agents' are crucial for outcomes of appointment procedures. Second, we identify three practices of coalitions of change agents that further the change agenda: seeking support, mobilizing moderate actors and counterbalancing routines. Our results suggest that if frontrunners receive support from and mobilize moderate change agents, routine gender practices can successfully be challenged and countered, as moderates give support and legitimacy to more radical actors and can bridge the gap between the latter and resisters. © 2020 European Academy of Management",
 "Tourism is increasingly important for wine regions and local economies. The purpose of this research is to use both symmetric (SEM) and asymmetric (fsQCA) methods to explore the role of motivation and involvement in tourists’ intention to return to a wine region. To test these relations the study uses an online survey to obtain a convenience sample of 292 responses from Rioja and Bordeaux wine tourists. The SEM model shows that participation in wine events and product involvement positively relate to the intention to return. Two sufficient configurations in the fsQCA consistently lead to the intention: high core wine and education, high product involvement, and high participation in wine events combined with escape and socialization or with the destination's attractiveness. These results can help wine managers and operators design differentiated strategies to address the specific needs of wine tourists. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Many users of social services in the United States live on low incomes. Those who receive Social Security disability benefits or who qualify for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits have incomes below the poverty line. Social service users often also face social and economic exclusion because of stigmatized conditions, disabling limitations, and skill and knowledge deficits. They are like other low-income consumers in some ways, but face additional challenges. This article views specific social service user populations as identity communities. In identity communities, community members share salient identities. Shared identity also may result from social and economic exclusion, and/or social stigma. Identity communities may be geographically bounded or unbounded. In either case, they have their own economies, which may or may not be recognized and developed. Focusing on the identity community of people with severe mental-health conditions, this article describes a methodology for designing business development projects within that community. The study describes the development of a replicable and potentially scalable business model, and how it was implemented in one case. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of this market-based approach to meeting the needs of poor social service populations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.',
 "Over the past few decades, the legitimacy of membership-based social movement organizations (SMOs) has been called into question (Bosso, 2005; Jordan and Maloney, 1997, 2007; Putnam, 2000). As professionally-run institutions, SMOs have been accused of a preoccupation with maintaining income through membership marketing at the expense of fostering active participation among their members. In a nutshell, SMOs are seen to be self-serving 'protest businesses' which contribute little to social movement activism, and civic engagement in general. Our research into student members of a leading SMO takes issue with this assertion. Whilst organizationally SMOs can appear bureaucratic and impersonal in their marketing strategies, it cannot be assumed that this approach is only capable of attracting passive 'chequebook activists'. Our findings suggest that younger members feel a sense of loyalty and trust towards the SMO as an effective 'brand leader' in its field, though this is by no means unrelenting. As reflexive consumers of activism, members have also grown more accustomed to the flexibilities of emerging post-bureaucratic 'DIY' activist groups. In sum, SMOs would benefit from a stronger and more consistent 'feedback loop' between the organization and its younger and more active members, as this will help provide scope for greater innovation whilst resisting tendencies towards self-serving 'bureaucratized activism'. © The Author(s) 2011.",
 "Though institutional contexts are critical drivers of firms’ international expansion, very limited research efforts have focused on how and when these factors facilitate developing country firms’ outward market activities. This study derives insights from the institution-based view and activity theory to test how perceived environmental uncertainty mediates the link between institutional impediments and international expansion. Using data from small and medium-sized firms from Ghana (N = 222) and Ethiopia (N = 203), the findings suggest that high levels of perceived regulatory and cognitive impediments amplify the mediation effect of perceived environmental uncertainty on the degree of SME's international expansion. Additionally, the findings suggest that, when political connections are well-developed and deployed, the potency of perceived environmental uncertainty as a driver of international expansion is attenuated. Moreover, the study finds that varying levels of home-country industry competition moderate the relationship between perceived environmental uncertainty and the degree of international expansion. Implications relating to theory and practice are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
 'Numerous scholars have suggested that the global technology-intensive sector has become hypercompetitive, yet few have tested this empirically. Those that have find seemingly conflicting evidence. Applying commonly used measures, we explore whether this could be due to hypercompetition being more time and context specific than previously thought. Based on data from the United States, Europe, Japan, and China covering 1980–2018, we find no indication of a generalized increase in business performance volatility in this sector across regions. We do find a declining stability in the performance of Japanese firms over the study period, but in US firms only leading up to the burst of the dotcom bubble. A structural break analysis helps us conclude that hypercompetition is a phenomenon limited in both location, time, and industry, linked to industry breakpoints across its life cycle. © 2023',
 'This research examines the integrated effects of external network ties and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on innovation performance. It also investigates how environmental dynamism affects the network ties-EO-innovation performance relationship. Drawing on the dynamic capability perspective of EO and the contingency view of network ties, we posit that business ties influence innovation performance through EO, while political ties affect innovation performance through business ties and EO. Moreover, we hypothesize that the indirect effects of business ties (through EO) and political ties (through business ties and EO) on innovation performance are stronger in more dynamic environments. Using a sample of 218 industrial firms from China, the findings support our arguments. Our in-depth examination of the relationship between network ties, EO and innovation performance results in some theoretical and managerial implications for discussion. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',

 'While most researchers criticize the effectiveness of states in Africa, state formation is proceeding, albeit gradually. This article analyzes state formation along the historically conflict-affected and fragile Karamoja-Teso sub-national border in north-eastern Uganda. I argue that the central state has consolidated control over the north-east and begun the process of politically incorporating Karamoja into Uganda for the first time in history-evidence of state formation. Yet, this success has unintentionally created space for renewed conflict in two ways: (i) a territorial conflict between and within the Teso and Karamoja local states over the legitimate location of the sub-national border, and (ii) rising competition over the utilization of land along the now secure border. I emphasize that tensions surrounding the border are far from a recent development; they are deeply rooted in political, economic, and cultural processes that stretch back centuries. This article makes the argument for evaluating state formation in Africa over the longue durée. It also seeks to build on recent work which underlines the historically contingent and shifting dynamics that shape, enable, and constrain state making in Africa. © The Author(s) 2018.

 'Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
 "We examine the strategic interplay between a buyer's design decision and the ensuing competition between suppliers in a three-tier closed-loop supply chain setting with significant recycling considerations. The nature of the engineering design decision in our research entails choice of integral versus modular design that has direct implications for the input raw material waste and ensuing competition between suppliers (i.e., incumbent and new). Whereas the integral design requires a large blank and generates excessive material scrap, the modular design reduces the generated scrap, and enhances cut-to-fit modularity, but incurs joining cost and yield loss. The incumbent supplier who supports the status quo choice of integral design can effectively recycle excessive material waste, as it is strategically located close to the source of material. The engineering design team at our study firm is currently exploring the option to source from alternative suppliers that can support either integral or modular designs, but have significantly lower effectiveness in recycling scrap material. We characterize the buyer's price sensitivity levels, component characteristics, supply chain configurations, and virgin and scrap specialty material prices that yield various design and sourcing policy alternatives. The buyer's optimal policy choice, the ensuing price-demand dynamics, and the resulting recycling implications demonstrate that the buyer can benefit from strategically tailoring his design decisions to affect the suppliers' material requirements and costs. We show that utilizing an alternative supply option is particularly valuable for components made from a material with a low price differential in virgin and scrap forms in supply chains wherein the new supplier base can recycle effectively. In such cases, the buyer induces severe price competition by dual sourcing the integral design, and competition may negate the seemingly obvious benefits of operational improvements (e.g., higher scrap material return rate). © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute.",
 'The paper assesses the international expansion of developed-country multinationals to base-of-the-pyramid markets to launch new-to-the-world product innovations. The case study, of Philips Lighting, uses an international-business framework on the transferability and development of capabilities during international expansion. Institutional distance limits transferability from developed-country markets to base-of-the-pyramid markets; heterogeneity limits transferability across base-of-the-pyramid markets. The case shows that only extant capabilities independent of an institutional context are transferable, thereby forcing the firm to pay more attention to locally building new capabilities for market research and distribution. The transferable capabilities are mainly procedural (such as a customer-centric vision, and experience in high-tech product development); collaboration with local partners eases the development of new capabilities. Firms can improve their base-of-the-pyramid internationalization strategy by assessing the transferability of their capabilities and by adapting their organizational structure to stimulate knowledge sharing when building new capabilities. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.',
 "This research responds to calls for a more integrative approach to leadership theory by identifying subpopulations of followers who share a common set of perceptions with respect to their leader's behaviors. Six commonly researched styles were investigated: abusive supervision, transformational leadership (TFL), contingent reward (CR), passive and active management-by-exception (MBE-P and MBE-A, respectively), and laissez faire/avoidant (LF/A). Study hypotheses were tested with data from four independent samples of working adults, three from followers (N = 855) and a validation sample of leaders (N = 505). Using latent profile analysis, three pattern cohorts emerged across all four samples. One subpopulation of followers exhibited a constructive pattern with higher scores on TFL and CR relative to other styles. Two cohorts exhibited destructive patterns, one where the passive styles of MBE-A, MBE-P and LF/A were high relative to the other styles (passive) and one where the passive styles co-occurred with abusive supervision (passive-abusive). Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we confirmed differential associations with work-related (i.e., burnout, vigor, perceived organizational support and affective organizational commitment) and context-free (i.e., physical health and psychological well-being) outcomes. The passive-abusive pattern was devastating for physical health, yet passiveness without abuse was damaging for psychological well-being. Interestingly, we find a clear demarcation between passiveness as “benign neglect” and passiveness as an intentional and deliberate form of leadership aimed at disrupting or undermining followers—hence, the two faces of passiveness: “bad” and “ugly.” We discuss the novel insights offered by a pattern (person)-oriented analytical strategy and the broader theoretical and practical implications for leadership research. © The Author(s) 2021.",
 'How do organisations that belong to a stigmatised industry manage negative perceptions? We contribute to answering this question by highlighting how organisational members turn external negative evaluations into positive self-idealisations. Our research offers a unique perspective on how stigmatised actors navigate their tarnished image, as well as how they remain attached to a group and its attributes despite its stigmatisation. The study reports findings from two French fruit and vegetable wholesalers, who are commonly perceived as thieves, bandits and unwanted intermediaries. We explain how organisational members were able to neutralise negative perceptions by mobilising and maintaining an idealised perception of their centrality. This structuring fantasy formed a powerful defence against stigmatised perceptions, transforming the stigma into self-idealisation that supported organisational stability. The organisations studied developed idealisation strategies based on members’ attachment to or distancing from nostalgic fantasies of the past. We suggest that awareness of the idealised construct that underpins a particular attachment to a stigmatised attribute may help organisations and their members free themselves from stigma. © The Author(s) 2024.',
 'Critical organization scholars have focused increasing attention on industrial and organizational restructurings such as shutdown decisions. However, little is known about the rhetorical strategies used to legitimate or resist plant closures in organizational negotiations. In this article, we draw from New Rhetoric to analyze rhetorical struggles, strategies and dynamics in unfolding organizational negotiations. We focus on the shutdown of the bus body unit of the Sweden-based Volvo Bus Corporation in Finland. We distinguish five types of rhetorical legitimation strategies and dynamics. These include the three classical dynamics of logos (rational arguments), pathos (emotional moral arguments), and ethos (authority-based arguments), but also autopoiesis (autopoietic narratives), and cosmos (cosmological constructions). Our analysis contributes to previous studies on organizational restructuring by providing a more nuanced understanding of how contemporary industrial closures are legitimated and resisted in organizational negotiations. This study also increases theoretical understanding of the role of rhetoric in legitimation more generally. © The Author(s), 2010.',
 'In contemporary developed Western societies, structural discrimination often bars ethnic minorities from entering mainstream entrepreneurship and labor markets. Consequently, minorities engage in microentrepreneurship for economic survival and to retain their social identities. Yet despite the economic value of ethnic minority microbusinesses, little is known about the underlying forces that develop fundamental resources which shape their performance. Based on Bourdieu’s forms of capital and the resource-based view of the firm, our study presents a novel culture-induced entrepreneurship model. This model explains how ethnic minority culture shapes the development of human capital resources and how these resources contribute to business performance in communities which are often characterized as “left behind.” Our study challenges the dominant underdog discourse of (cultural) capital deficit among ethnic minority entrepreneurs. © 2023 The Author(s).

 "We study how analysts' recommendations affect firms' strategies during radical technological shifts. We find, from our study of firms in three industries undergoing technological change, that analysts' recommendations trigger changes in strategic investments during periods of uncertain technological change. We also find that firms that make high investments despite negative analysts' recommendations announce a higher value of share repurchases, an action that may offset the growing illegitimacy of these increased investments by signaling alignment with shareholders' interests. Radical technological changes provide a source of exogenous variation that contributes to explanation of how firms balance technological pressures for adaptation and institutional pressures for legitimacy. © 2012 Academy of Management Journal.",
 "This article argues that a discourse which constructs the Internet as an inclusive development tool that can be deployed in strategies for modernizing Africa has become hegemonic among development donors and telecommunications organizations. Based on research carried out in and around three Internet cafes in Dar es Salaam, and one Multipurpose Community Telecentre (MCT) in Sengerema, this article takes issue with this discourse and suggests that the geographies of inclusion and exclusion created by the Internet are more complex. For Tanzania's information and communication technologies (ICT) elites, the Internet will shape the population into knowledge- and market-seeking, productive citizens, stimulating national growth. For Internet cafe users and non-users, the Internet has become a marker of modernity, a way for people and places to indicate their relative level of development, and Internet use is currently dominated by leisure, communication and information relating to global popular culture. However, the article demonstrates that development interventions which turn the symptoms of poverty into technical problems to be solved with technological responses are inherently flawed, since the failure to deal with the causes of poverty means that the majority of Tanzanians continue to be excluded from the 'information society'. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",
 "The authors adopt and develop an institutional perspective to advance understanding of how host country environments influence subsidiary staffing strategies. They propose and find that (a) firms rely more on expatriates in institutionally distant environments for reasons related to the efficient transfer of management practices and firm-specific capabilities and (b) the positive influence of expatriate staffing levels on subsidiary performance is dependent on the institutional distance between the host and home country, and subsidiary experience. The authors' findings are based on their analysis of expatriate employment levels and performance in 12,997 foreign subsidiaries of 2,952 Japanese firms in 48 countries. © 2007 Southern Management Association.

 "The purpose of this paper is to advance the knowledge in the under-developed literature on management innovation in the services sector. Management innovation entails new internal organizational methods in which managers are closely and directly involved. Therefore, its introduction can be a powerful tool in managers' hands to promote their firms' success. Data obtained from 109 firms were analysed using structural equations modelling, in order to evaluate the influence of management innovation on different organizational outcomes. The results show that management innovation activities favour the introduction of learning capability and product innovation. Moreover, it indirectly affects the achievement of financial performance through its effect on product innovation. © 2016 European Academy of Management.",
 'Based on an exploratory thematic analysis of the interviews with representatives of brands with intense ethnic digital self-presentation and on confirmatory analysis of the content of the brands’ digital media, this qualitative study introduces a notion of brand identity work. Four contributions are made: theorising brand identity work as a process of identity construction that involves brand building and brand presentation; unpacking a typology of tensions between brand building and brand presentation specific to ethnic marketing; suggesting a dynamic view of authenticity and uncovering a typology of presentation strategies that address these conflicts. We find that behind the tensions between brand-building and brand presentation stands brands’ concern about authenticity. Depending on the type of authenticity tensions, brands develop self-presentation strategies, notably, celebrity endorsement. Social media content analysis shows that brands use self-presentation strategies separately or in combination. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',
 "The emergence of Industry 4.0 offers firms internationalization opportunities employing digital platforms and emerging technologies. Relying upon the Uppsala model as applied in light of a firm case study, we contribute to the validity of the Uppsala model 2017. We respond to the counterpoint by Coviello, Kano, and Liesch (2017) to the Uppsala 2017 model, answering the question, What is the impact of Industry 4.0 on the validity of the 2017 version of the Uppsala model? This study builds on a qualitative research methodology through a single case study of Delivery Hero, a global service provider firm. We adopt an extensive longitudinal approach to understand a startup firm's digital business concept and business evolution, including its internationalization paths. We conclude that the mechanisms of the Uppsala model are valid, but their characteristics have changed by digital and globalized value-adding processes. The dynamic capabilities possessed by the founding entrepreneur turn out to constitute a critical micro foundation for the firm's international business success. Our findings explain these change mechanisms, illustrating the stepwise progression process led by entrepreneurial decision-making. Industry 4.0 technologies have changed the very manner by which ﬁrms arrange their value-adding activities with their business stakeholders in course of the firm's internationalization. By relying on reasonable business targets, algorithms, and data management systems, real-time market monitoring enables international startup firms to learn and adopt local identities faster, thereby efficiently alleviating liabilities of foreignness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
 'Local firms in their home countries often engage in behavior that constitutes corruption, at least through some cultural lenses. One such practice is bribery of public officials. This study uses multilevel theory to address the question of why bribery activity of this type differs among countries. We analyze responses from nearly 4,000 firms worldwide using hierarchical linear modeling to investigate cross-level predictions about bribery. Drawing from anomie theory, we find support for country-level cultural and institutional drivers of firm-level bribery. We extend anomie theory by showing how firm-level pressures can encourage the supplying of bribes as a firm strategy. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.',
 "Normative benchmarks for a brand's network of associations provide managers with guidelines to set brand strategy. Benchmarks also help marketers evaluate the impact of marketing activities. This paper outlines an approach to obtain benchmarks for the relative size and structure of a brand's associative network using the NBD-Dirichlet model (Goodhardt, Ehrenberg, & Chatfield, 1984). The results reveal an excellent fit, showing that the NBD-Dirchlet is able to obtain predictions for a brand's mental market share. This finding has implications for understanding of the structure of consumers' memory for brands and the dynamic nature of the associative network across brands and time. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",
 'We explore the differences in international strategy between multinational enterprises (MNEs) in services and manufacturing, especially in terms of their international diversification, as measured by their sales and asset dispersion. Our longitudinal data show that the largest MNEs in services have a much stronger home-region orientation than manufacturing MNEs. Large MNEs in the services sector average 83.9 percent of their sales in their home region, which is significantly higher than large manufacturing firms at 65.6 percent. We explore the possible reasons for the relative lack of globalization of services firms. The two main reasons are: the difficulty of adapting separately upstream activities and downstream activities in high distance host environments, and the difficulty of selecting activity locations as a function of supply side criteria. We offer a refinement of regional strategy theory applicable to services MNEs. © Gabler Verlag 2008.',
 'Research has established the relevance of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to firm performance but skepticism remains because of the ambiguity surrounding how EO might improve firm performance. We examine the key concepts of absorptive capacity and improvisation as two alternative learning modes serving as intermediate steps between EO and firm performance. Locating our study within manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia, we find that absorptive capacity enhances the EO–performance relationship, both as a moderator and a mediator. In contrast to expectations, however, improvisation showed no such effects but conferred its own separate benefits instead. We further discuss the different effects of these learning modes on high performance and low performance groups. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.',

 'The assumption of strategy approaches like the resource based view is that, despite environmental constraints, ample room remains for organizations to differentiate on the basis of organizational culture (together with related human resource practices) to achieve sustained competitive advantage. In contrast, other perspectives assume that management practice and organizational culture mirror, or are constrained by, national culture. To the degree that such a constraint exists, within-country variance in culture should be small and between-country variance large. In statistical terms, the first question is: what is the magnitude of the effect size for country? The larger the effect, the more likely it is a constraint. Second, what portion of the country effect size is due to differences in national culture? My review finds that most of the variance in organizational cultures is not explained by country; of the variance that is explained by country, only a minority is due to national culture differences. As such, there may be more room for organizational differentiation than typically recognized. Third, under what circumstances will country and national culture effects be larger or smaller? I present a model suggesting more room for differentiation in countries having greater individual level variance in cultural values and related variables. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.',
 "Drawing on the Coase theorem, we consider a firm's decision to transfer patent ownership to another firm in the markets for innovation. We deem that the proximity of a patent's technology structure to that of a firm's patent portfolio will generally result in greater marginal productivity of the patent, leading to enhanced prospects for the firm's economic return. We thus predict that firms are more likely to trade patents when the technology structure of a patent is closer to the technology stock of a potential buyer compared with that of its original assignee. However, such a relationship will be weaker when a potential buyer and the original assignee have greater product-market overlap or when the assignee has superior technological capability. We test these predictions by employing a dyad-level analysis of transactional decisions during the 1987-2016 period on 40,110 U.S. patents assigned to 57 major biopharmaceutical firms. Our study provides novel insights on factors that facilitate or inhibit patent trade in the markets for innovation. © 2021 INFORMS",
 'Work on firm-specific advantages developed by emerging market multinationals largely focuses on their ability to copy those created by similar companies from the developed world. The predominance of new institutional economics in this field has limited our understanding of how these firms develop different firm-specific advantages by presuming not only that the institutional context in advanced industrialized countries is the best for creating such advantages, but also that local context does not shape the potential effectiveness of any such advantage. This article argues that comparative institutionalism better enables scholars to understand this phenomena. However, until now this theory has only examined how firm-specific advantages are derived from country-specific advantages. I argue that it needs to be revised so that it can account for how emerging market multinationals develop firm-specific advantages suited to emerging markets by building on their experience in addressing what this author terms location disadvantages. It illustrates this argument by examining how an Argentine Multilatina, IMPSA, was able to outperform its competitors from the developed world and become the leading producer of dams and windmill parks in Latin America by addressing location disadvantages in supplier markets. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.',
 "How does a founder's knowledge of debt financing influence his/her new firm's ability to obtain the amount of debt financing it desires? Building on the cognitive psychology literature, we propose that the depth of a founder's debt financing knowledge is positively associated with the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing as he/she will be better at selecting and acquiring relevant sources of debt financing. Integrating insights on entrepreneurial growth-oriented strategies, we further argue that this relationship will be more pronounced when the new firm internationalizes and innovates more. Using a Heckman full information maximum likelihood model, we analyse survey data on 1845 Flemish new firms. The first stage of the model estimates the new firm's probability of raising debt financing. The second stage tests the relationship between the founder's knowledge depth of debt financing and the new firm's debt financing ability, conditional on the decision to raise debt financing. We find that the founder's knowledge depth of debt financing is positively associated with the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing. This association becomes even more pronounced when the new firm internationalizes more. These findings extend the entrepreneurial finance, entrepreneurial strategy and cognitive psychology literature. © 2023 British Academy of Management.",
 'It has become increasingly common for advocates for various social issues—the en-vironment, diversity and inclusion, supply chain workers, and others—to make the business case for pursuing these goals. Even “shared value” approaches insist that the win-win formula always meets the needs of the bottom line first. Recently, however, scholars have called into question the effectiveness of the “business case” justification and have even suggested that it might do more harm than good. The problems arise because the business case may not actually motivate managers to act, it may be alienating to those for whom the business case is being made, and it may create moral struggles for the people who feel they must make the business case to justify social action. As a result, although the field of strategic management and management more generally has been focused on establishing if, or under what conditions, corporate social responsibility is associated with financial performance, emerging research suggests that this kind of evidence would not necessarily have a positive impact on making a change. © of the Academy of Management.',
 'This study shows that upgrading sales operations in host countries towards production allows MNCs to perform global arbitrage in their networks of foreign subsidiaries and thereby contributes to a strategy of reaping the benefits of multinationality. We predict and find that operation upgrades follow opportunities of improving resource flows in the subsidiary network to exploit the advantages of host countries in tax rates, investment incentives, and technological knowledge across borders. Performance effects on the level of the MNC network give evidence of these benefits from global arbitrage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd',
 "Research Summary: Health science firms have long product development horizons and need regulatory approval for market entry. In communicating with investors, they may use entrepreneurial orientation (EO) rhetoric to emphasize their strategic and behavioral commitment to product innovation and market entry. However, because EO rhetoric constitutes a soft-information signal rather than evidence of substantive commitment, investors may suspect firm insiders using such rhetoric of impression management. The solution, we argue, is EO rhetoric sustained over time, which produces more reliable information for investors—in contrast to occasional increases in EO rhetoric, which invite skeptical scrutiny. Nevertheless, investors' potential concerns regarding changes in EO rhetoric can be mitigated by concurrent hard-information signals that carry signaling costs or penalty costs for false signaling. Managerial Summary: Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) rhetoric can reduce information asymmetry between managers and investors. In strictly regulated contexts such as health science industries, using such rhetoric may be challenging. For firms embracing entrepreneurial strategies and behaviors, maintaining EO rhetoric over time is critical to overcoming skepticism that it is merely “cheap talk.” For investors, this study also suggests that health science firms maintaining higher EO rhetoric over time deserve higher valuations, given the variety of benefits an EO can have for health science firms. If a health science firm aims to ramp up its EO rhetoric, managers should be aware that investors may interpret the increase as impression management and should confront this interpretation head-on—for instance, by simultaneously increasing entry commitment or corporate social responsibility. © 2021 The Authors.

 "This study examines the roles of entrepreneur motivation and a potentially adverse founding condition in disengagement of nascent entrepreneurs from the start-up process. Specifically, measures of goal commitment, self-efficacy, and perceived competition intensity from 943 nascent entrepreneurs are employed to predict disengagement as reported one year later. Results indicate that high perceived competition intensity renders the otherwise strong negative main effect of goal commitment on disengagement, not significant. The even stronger negative main effect of self-efficacy on disengagement, however, is not contingent on perceived competition intensity. Further, perceived competition intensity by itself does not appear to influence nascent entrepreneurs' disengagement. © 2013 International Council for Small Business.",
 "Many multinational enterprises (MNEs) claim to be pursuing a 'global strategy', but the majority of MNEs is not global, in the sense that these firms cannot emulate their domestic success outside of their home region. This inability is largely caused by compounded distance among regions and can be mitigated in part, by infusing a regional component into the MNE's international strategy. In this paper, we explore whether internalization theory can address the global versus regional strategy phenomenon. Specifically, we investigate whether internalization theory can predict under which circumstances MNEs will be able to pursue successfully a global strategy, and whether the theory can explain firm-level variations in utilizing regional components in international strategic governance. We argue that internalization theory can help regionalization scholars unbundle regional strategy by matching resource bundling needs with various firm-level resource recombination practices. We identify four distinct resource recombination processes with increasing complexity: fast bundling, principles-driven bundling, adaptive bundling and entrepreneurial resource orchestration, and argue that adopting the best-matched resource recombination practices will advance the MNE's success outside of its home region. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",
 'Prior studies examining factors that influence the learning curve mainly focus on settings in which firms adopt new products or technologies or open new plants or assembly lines. Less is known, however, about how more mature firms learn, when they are further down the learning curve. To gain insight into factors that enhance learning in this situation, I examine factors that increase both the ability and the opportunity to learn. I hypothesize that the ability to learn is enhanced by the presence of a moderate amount of temporary employees in the workforce and by providing employees with related variation in tasks, measured by product heterogeneity. In addition, I hypothesize that opportunities for learning are created when there is some slack in resources and when there are no problems in other important performance dimensions that consume employee attention. These hypotheses are examined using data of the Royal Dutch Mail, which has 27 geographically dispersed regions. Although these 27 regions are homogeneous with respect to their tasks, internal organization, type of products delivered, and technology used, their learning rates differ considerably. In the sample of 972 observations used for this analysis, I find that this variation in learning rates is explained by the percentage of temporary employees used, the level of excess capacity, the degree of product heterogeneity, and the degree to which regions face problems in other important performance dimensions. These findings provide insight into strategies that help managers in designing work processes to maintain a positive learning curve. © 2007 INFORMS.',
 'There is much enthusiasm for analytics and the measurement of intangibles, such as human capital. In stark contrast, the study of strategic human capital analytics is plagued with definitional disunity, a lack of empirical research, and inconsistent results from the handful of research studies that have been undertaken. This study contributes to the extant literature and academic debate through the original and foundational study of strategic human capital analytics effect on organisation and market performance and mediation by managerial decision-making drawn from the resource-based view, human resource accounting and persuasion theory. Our analyses, from a sample of 383 senior- and middle-level managers, suggest that managerial decision-making determines the extent to which strategic human capital analytics, as part of a strategic performance measurement and management system, improve organisation and market performance. Implications for theory and practice in this emergent field of study are discussed along with directions for future research. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',
 'In this paper we introduce a novel method—generative critical conversation (GCC)—which we propose can develop educator and researcher reflexivity and enhance criticality in enterprise and entrepreneurship education (EEE). We ground this method in literature from the field of educational research and reflexivity scholarship. We hybridize three methodological elements—the self-study strategy of reflecting on recorded material; exploring lived experiences through cogenerative dialogue, and a focus on critical questioning—to facilitate the development of educator-researcher reflexivity. We use illustrations from our own conversations to show how GCC opens up space over time to access and move between levels of reflexive interpretation. We suggest enabling conditions that support GCC and its potential as a method for developing educator-researcher reflexivity across EEE, initial teacher education, and other fields of research. © 2021 International Council for Small Business.',
 "Extending the research on performance feedback and problemistic search, which theorizes that firm performance below the aspiration level triggers organizational search behaviors, this study examines how the inside-outside distinction of the firm management team and board members can influence the allocation of organizational attention to the performance feedback process. A longitudinal study of Korean manufacturing firms demonstrates that while a firm management team's outside experience intensifies the firm's R&D investment in response to underperformance, this effect is substituted by the presence of outside directors on the board. Our results indicate that both managers and board members can have notable influence on performance feedback and suggest that performance feedback research should examine the factors that affect the attention processing of key decision makers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

 'The formation of a hybrid organizational identity is a significant challenge for many social enterprises. Drawing on in-depth longitudinal data from the first three years of a successful social enterprise – Fairphone, founded in Amsterdam – we induce an empirically grounded theoretical model of how a hybrid organizational identity is formed. We identify a general process of organizational identity formation, with founders, leaders and members experimenting with different organizational characters describing ‘who they are’ as well as with alternative social impact strategies defining ‘what they do’. As part of this experimental process, we elaborate the role of a key leadership process – ‘rekeying’, which involves leaders re-figuring prior understandings into more dual readings – which we found facilitates ongoing adaptation and helps members of the organization to become progressively better able at combining multiple objectives and values as part of a shared hybrid identity. Our theoretical model of hybrid organizational identity formation has a number of direct implications for ongoing research on organizational identity formation and hybrid organizations. © 2020 The Authors.

 "Does consistency between how a firm treats employees (what it does) and its espoused employee-oriented values (what it says) affect employee productivity? Furthermore, given that the stakeholder theory perspective holds that what happens to one stakeholder influences other stakeholders, does this sort of consistency vis-à-vis a firm's customers also influence employee productivity? We empirically investigate the influence of organizational authenticity-defined as consistency between a firm's espoused values and realized practices-in the context of a merger, and specifically during post-merger integration. Our findings show that a lack of organizational authenticity in terms of both under-promising and over-promising to both employees and customers is associated with lower productivity, which in turn is related to long-term merger performance, thus affecting outcomes for shareholders. These findings support the importance of authenticity and should therefore be of interest to executives responsible for ensuring the consistency between what a firm says and what it does, as well as those who participate in and study the merger integration process. In particular, we propose stakeholder theory as a helpful lens for examining the merger integration process as well as other joint actions such as strategic alliances. © 2014 The Academy of Management Perspectives.",
 "We expand the institutional perspective of international business by exploring the range of institutions outside the host country that influence international business. We use a critical case, Myanmar, to explore the dynamics of institutional constraints and the reaction of business to such constraints.

 'In the high-stakes race for scalability, some blockchains have turned to committee-based consensus (CBC), whereby the chain’s recordkeeping rights are entrusted to a committee of block producers elected via approval voting. Smaller committees boost speed and scalability but can compromise security when voters have limited information. In this environment, voting strategies are naturally nonlinear, and equilibria can become intractable. Despite this, we show that elections converge to optimality asymptotically (in voter numbers), exponentially quickly, and under relatively weak informational requirements. Compared to popular stake-weighted lottery and single-vote protocols used in practice, we find that CBC, when paired with approval voting, can offer meaningful efficiency and robustness gains if enough voters are engaged. © 2023 INFORMS.',

Yet, other external environmental influences have posed major challenges for charitable organizations within the wider voluntary sector. This paper aims to rectify the current lack of empirical research on how charitable organizations have responded in terms of their strategic positioning to the changing external operating environment and policy context. It both explores the positioning strategies adopted by two contrasting British charities that deliver public services in different ways, and investigates the factors that have influenced their choice of positioning strategies. The cases studied extend our knowledge of strategic positioning in organizations other than commercial (for-profit) ones. The findings provide new evidence that charities have begun to strategically position themselves in response to both internal organizational factors and external environmental influences. Emerging lessons from the experiences of the case study organizations provide guidance to charity managers in planning and implementing strategic positioning in their organizations. The findings also underscore the need to develop theoretical and conceptual management models specific to non-profit organizations, such as charities. © 2007 British Academy of Management.',
 'Previous researchers have questioned whether the association between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and organizational performance indicates causality. Strategic human resource management theories, including the resource-based view of the firm and the behavioral perspective, have provided explanations linking human resource management practices to organizational performance. We add arguments based upon general systems theory to suggest a more complex relationship where performance provides feedback on HPWS in the form of information and resources. This feedback generates both the data and the slack resources needed to support an adaptive process of HPWS implementation. We test the causal associations between HPWS and performance using a large longitudinal data set with three time points. Findings showed that past HPWS positively contributes to later productivity as well as the reverse. The reciprocal relationship supports the need to extend strategic human resource management theory by considering productivity as an antecedent as well as an outcome of human resource management practices. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.',
 'Big data analytics has become an imperative for business leaders across every industry sector. Analytics applications that can deliver a competitive advantage appear all along the supply chain decision spectrum-from targeted location-based marketing to optimizing supply chain inventories to enabling supplier risk assessment. While many companies have used it to extract new insights and create new forms of value, other companies have yet to leverage big data to transform their supply chain operations. This article examines how leading companies use big data analytics to drive their supply chains and offers a framework for implementation based on lessons learned.',
 'Existing literature addresses the concomitant internationalization path of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) in both advanced and emerging countries. This strategy requires that ambidextrous EMNEs simultaneously explore new capabilities and exploit their home-based capabilities. However, little is known about how this process actually happens. The ambidexterity implementation in emerging multinationals was unbundled by focusing on how three key process variables unfold: operation mode, organizational structure, and resource competition. A single, in-depth, process-based case study in a Brazilian multinational in the information technology sector that has operations in the United States, China, Taiwan, Latin America, Africa and Europe was analyzed. This firm is an outstanding example that adds value to current knowledge about ambidexterity in practice. By way of extensive data collection of interviews, field notes, and more than 120 pieces of secondary data, showed that exploration-exploitation tensions relating to resource competition are considerably reduced by combining different entry modes and insulated organizational structures. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Creating an innovative product and validating an innovative business model may not be enough for digital startups to be competitive. To grow fast and expand globally, digital startups need to innovate their business model during the scaling phase. A pragmatic approach has recently been proposed to support digital entrepreneurs engaging in business-model innovation during the scaling phase (i.e., business-model scaling), a strategy known as growth hacking. However, we know little about its theoretical grounding and how effective growth hacking is, as businesses lack methodologies to assess its effectiveness before committing resources and investments. To fill this gap, we developed a method for supporting business- model scaling through simulation modeling and provided an illustrative application to the PayPal case. By doing so, we contribute to the ongoing debate on scalability in digital entrepreneurship. © 2023 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.',
 'In the USA, governors became central figures in the fight against the novel coronavirus. In many cases, state leaders were forced to choose between preserving life and protecting economic livelihood. While prior research has underscored the important role that US governors played in implementing healthcare policies at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we know little about how characteristics of state leaders impacted self-employment. In this paper, we draw from upper echelons theory to examine how governor party and discretion impacted venture creation in the food and restaurant industry. Interestingly, we find no significant relationship between governor party and venture creation. However, we find that when the governor and legislature were unified in their political party — irrespective of party line — there were a higher number of new food and restaurant ventures created. We also found this effect to be strengthened when small business unemployment levels were higher. We explore the implications of these results for how unity of command may be beneficial during times of crisis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',
 'We scrutinize the explanatory power of one of the key concepts in International Business: the concept of (cultural) distance. Here we focus on its effect on entry mode choice, one of the most researched fields in international business strategy. Our findings might, however, be equally be relevant for the field of International Business as a whole. Our analysis is based on a review of 92 prior studies on entry mode choice, as well as an empirical investigation in over 800 subsidiaries of MNCs, covering nine host and fifteen home countries across the world. We conclude that the explanatory power of distance is highly limited once home and host country context are accounted for, and that any significant effects of cultural distance on entry mode choice might simply be caused by inadequate sampling. Entry mode studies in particular, and International Business research in general, would do well to reconsider its fascination with distance measures, and instead, focus first and foremost on differences in home and host country context. We argue that serious engagement with deep contextualization is necessary in International Business research to pose new and relevant questions and develop new and innovative theories that explain empirical phenomena. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.',
 'Scholars indicate significant interest in business models that support entrepreneurial behavior in developing markets [Wankel C., editor. Alleviating Poverty through Business Strategy. New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2008]-particularly as they relate to job creation. This research introduces microfranchising as a business model adaptation that helps low-income individuals overcome non credit-related barriers to entry in obtaining employment. This study reveals a clear challenge for researchers-to better understand microfranchising and the extent to which the practice creates employment and enables individual business success. Largely unanswered questions concern the profiles of typical microfranchisees as well as the impacts of microfranchising on low-income individuals in subsistence marketplaces. This preliminary research focuses on one type of microfranchise operating in Accra, Ghana. Using data from microfranchises enables the exploration of whether workers in subsistence markets benefit from the microfranchise model. In comparing a microfranchise business with comparably-sized non-franchised businesses, this analysis finds preliminary evidence that the microfranchise creates starter jobs. Baseline results highlight microfranchisee characteristics and indicate that this form of microfranchising positively impacts savings and profits. © 2009.',
 "In an era where both human and virtual influencers play pivotal roles in shaping consumer behavior, understanding their influence on consumers' reactions to service failures has become an essential scholarly pursuit. This research stands at the forefront of this burgeoning field, dissecting the unique impact of human versus virtual influencers on consumer attitudes toward service failures, including forgiveness propensity, behavioral responses, and punishment intention. Through a series of experimental studies, the research uncovers a nuanced preference for virtual influencers, who elicit higher levels of forgiveness, more positive behavioral responses, and lower punitive intentions during service failures. These findings are mediated by mind perception and responsibility attribution, and are moderated by familiarity, thereby unveiling a complex interplay of psychological processes. The study's contributions transcend mere observations, offering a theoretical framework with empirical testing that integrates consumer psychology with the emergent phenomenon of virtual influencers. The insights gleaned from this research not only enhance academic understanding of the dynamics between influencer types and consumer reactions but also provide actionable strategies for marketers. By bridging theory and practice, this study carves a new path in influencer marketing research, particularly illuminating how to leverage influencer types to mitigate negative consumer reactions due to service failures. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",
 'A well-known principle in economics is that firms differentiate their product offerings in order to relax competition. However, in this paper we show that information frictions can invalidate this principle. We build a duopolistic competition model of second-degree price discrimination with information frictions in which (i) an equilibrium always exists with overlapping product qualities, whereas (ii) an equilibrium with nonoverlapping product qualities exists only if both information frictions and the cost of providing high quality are sufficiently small. As a consequence, reasons other than an attempt to soften competition should explain why firms in some cases carry nonoverlapping product lines. © 2021 INFORMS',
 'City branding is a relatively new area of academic research in marketing. Earlier research focuses on city brand images and particularly the contrast in brand image between cities. Essentially that attention reflects the interest of policy makers in developing sound competitive brand positions, with the aim of achieving a competitive advantage. The current paper shifts the focus to explaining the brand attitudes that residents have of a particular city. What are the key antecedents (city attributes) influencing city brand attitudes? The paper reports on a quantitative survey of a sample of 878 residents of the Gold Coast City. The findings show that the major antecedents are social bonds, a sun and surf brand personality, and creative business. Safety, nature and cultural activities are also influential attributes. Apart from insight into how city brand attitudes are shaped, the paper provides a framework for public policy intervention to improve the urban environment. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

 'In this article, the authors empirically study the transfer of knowledge across international boundaries through a case study. Using data from field-based research in India, they comment on the similarities between the encounter between a multinational corporation (MNC) and its contractor located in the third world and older relationships between institutions in the era of colonialism. The authors contend that even though the MNC was able in this case to appropriate a value-creating process from its contractor over the short term, its actions are still potentially counterproductive in the long run. They analyze this episode of knowledge transfer using the theoretical constructs of signification and hegemony, where dominant social groups seek to manufacture the consent of subordinate groups, an act that often remains incomplete and contested. © 2009 Sage Publications.',
 'This article considers the familiness construct within the resource-based view of the firm by examining the manner in which intangible and other unique resources translate into competitive advantages held by family businesses. Specifically, this article, through a case-based approach, questions whether the familiness qualities of a firm contribute to actualization of an effective market orientation thereby constituting a competitive advantage. Analysis of multiple interviews from family owners and managers suggests that familiness qualities, including, but not limited to, strategic focus, customer orientation, family relationships, and operational efficiency, do contribute to a propensity for execution of an effective market orientation. © 2007 Family Firm Institute, Inc.',
 "Purpose: This paper examines the innovation behavior of family-owned firms versus non-family-owned firms. The role of internal family governance and the influence of external stimuli (competition) on innovation are also considered. Design/methodology/approach: The data of 20,995 family and non-family firms across 38 countries are derived from the World Bank Enterprise Survey during the period 2019–2020. Probit models are used to examine the impact of family ownership, family governance, and competition on innovation outcomes. Findings: Family firms are more likely to make R&D investments, acquire external knowledge, engage in product innovation (including innovations that are new to the market) and process innovation, relative to non-family firms. However, a high propensity of family member involvement in top management positions can reduce innovation. Competition has a negative impact on innovation outcomes for both family and non-family firms, but it has a positive moderating effect on the innovation activities of family firms where a higher level of family member involvement in management is present. Originality/value: This paper provides novel insights into family firm innovation dynamics by identifying family firms as more innovative than non-family firms for all types of indicators, debunking the idea that family firms are conservative, reluctant to change, and averse to the risks in innovation activities. However, too much family involvement in decision making may stifle some innovation activities in family firms, except in cases where the operating environment is highly competitive; this provides new insights into the ownership-management dynamic of family firms. © 2022, Yuping Yin, Frank Crowley, Justin Doran, Jun Du and Mari O'Connor.",
 'We add to the theory of entrepreneurial firm growth by inductively theorizing the processes through which new high-growth firms utilize their partnering portfolios to pursue distinctive approaches to growth. We extend the strategic perspective on entrepreneurial networks by identifying three mechanisms linking partnering portfolios to differences in firm growth: configuring partnering portfolios to pursue distinctive logics for sourcing external resources, aligning resource-sourcing and resource-linking logics in new product development, and embarking on different growth trajectories, which contribute to different performance patterns. These theoretical insights contribute to current understanding of the external and internal sources of heterogeneity in the performance of entrepreneurial firms.

 'Emerging markets, and especially lower-tier cities within these markets, are seen as the future growth engines for luxury brands. However, extant literature on the drivers of luxury consumption has predominantly focused on Tier-1 cities. Grounded in the theory of network effects, this study offers first such intra and inter-country comparison of the symbolic motivations (i.e. snob, bandwagon and Veblen motivations) underpinning luxury purchases between and within Tier-1 and lower-tier cities in two prominent emerging markets, China and India. The findings offer first account of similarities and differences in consumer motivations that drive luxury consumption within and between these markets. While most luxury brands have ubiquitous strategies for emerging markets, the results will assist managers in developing distinctive brand strategies catering to the intra and inter-country differences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd',
 'Fulfillment strategies that offer consumers a consistent shopping experience across different channels and devices through a variety of last-mile delivery options have emerged as a powerful engine for growth in the retail sector. To thrive in this new environment, retailers need to (re)configure their last-mile supply networks to achieve better alignment between delivery responsiveness, product variety, and convenience. This article reviews multiple case studies of leading retailers across geographical regions, maps these retailers’ network configurations, and conducts consumer surveys to examine how retailers operate their last-mile distribution to cope with omnichannel demands. This study develops a typology consisting of four ideal forms of last-mile supply networks differentiated by the speed of delivery responsiveness and level of product variety. It proposes a set of prescriptive guidelines for retailers to undertake reconfiguration of their last-mile distribution. © The Regents of the University of California 2018.',
 "In this study, we bridge two streams of foreign direct investment literature, specifically studies on establishment mode choice (i.e., the choice between an acquisition and a greenfield establishment) and studies on entry mode choice (i.e., the choice between a wholly owned outlet and a subsidiary with shared ownership). We arrive at a conceptual synthesis for an examination of the effects of the same predictors on the dual entry-establishment mode choice made in the context of a single foreign investment. We demonstrate that a parent firm's technological intensity, international strategy and experience determine both establishment and entry mode choices. Moreover, we apply Williamson's new institutional economics to investigate the influence of institution building on multinational enterprises' dual investment choice. In the context of transition economies, we test empirically the possible moderating effect of a host country's institutional environment. We conclude that the degree of the host country's institutional advancement moderates the effect of both technological intensity and international strategy on the establishment and entry mode choice. © 2007 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.",
 'As many high-profile business leaders purport to make decisions based on gut feelings, a growing number of management scholars are seeking to explain how leaders use intuition in organizational settings. In line with dual-process theories, management scholars argue that the most effective decision makers are cognitively versatile, which means that they are able to ‘switch cognitive gears’ between intuition and analysis and, more importantly, that they are able to use both types of processing at high levels. Although this has important implications, the actual use of intuition as well as cognitive versatility have received limited scholarly attention. Motivated by the desire to address this gap, we pose the following research question: To what extent is experience associated with a) intuition and b) cognitive versatility, and with what effects? We consider the influence of domain-specific experience because this is considered to be a prerequisite for intuition, and we explore the effects in the context of new venture ideation which is a precursor to and the lifeblood of entrepreneurial action, not only for founders of new ventures but also for managers of existing organizations who seek to drive innovation and be entrepreneurial. We build on insights from the dual-process Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory, as well as the literature on managerial and entrepreneurial intuition, to develop a conceptual model, which we test on data collected from 74 technology-entrepreneurs via think-aloud protocol analysis and an online survey. We find that experienced entrepreneurs are able to use both intuition and analysis extensively during new venture ideation, and that the use of intuition is most effective for new venture ideation when used together with analysis – both at high levels – in a cognitively versatile strategy. © 2022 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
 'Reverse auctions in business-to-business (B2B) exchanges provide numerous benefits to participants. Arguably the most notable benefit is that of lowered prices driven by increased competition in such auctions. The competition between sellers in reverse auctions has been analyzed using a game-theoretic framework and equilibria have been established for several scenarios. One finding of note is that, in a setting in which sellers can meet total demand with the highest-bidding seller being able to sell only a fraction of the total capacity, the sellers resort to a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Although price randomization in industrial bidding is an accepted norm, one might argue that in reality managers do not utilize advanced game theory calculations in placing bids. More likely, managers adopt simple learning strategies. In this situation, it remains an open question as to whether the bid prices converge to the theoretical equilibrium over time. To address this question, we model reverse-auction bidding behavior by artificial agents as both two-player and n-player games in a simulation environment. The agents begin the game with a minimal understanding of the environment but over time analyze wins and losses for use in determining future bids. To test for convergence, the agents explore the price space and exploit prices where profits are higher, given varying cost and capacity scenarios. In the two-player case, the agents do indeed converge toward the theoretical equilibrium. The n-player case provides results that reinforce our understanding of the theoretical equilibria. These results are promising enough to further consider the use of artificial learning mechanisms in reverse auctions and other electronic market transactions, especially as more sophisticated mechanisms are developed to tackle real-life complexities. We also develop the analytical results when one agent does not behave strategically while the other agent does and show that our simulations for this environment also result in convergence toward the theoretical equilibrium. Because the nature of the best response in the new setting is very different (pure strategy as opposed to mixed), it indicates the robustness of the devised algorithm. The use of artificial agents can also overcome the limitations in rationality demonstrated by human managers. The results thus have interesting implications for designing artificial agents in automating bid responses for large numbers of bids where human intervention might not always be possible. © 2008, Decision Sciences Institute.',

 "Innovation is often perceived as an unmanageable phenomenon. Bets are placed on new products with the hope that a few winners will compensate for the many losers. At best, sophisticated selection procedures impose a certain discipline and provide guidance for containing costly errors. The research that we have conducted yields a more nuanced view. Innovation, we have found, becomes manageable when managers move away from universalistic prescriptions and recognise that different rules and practices apply in different contexts. Our main argument is that both executives and public officials need to learn from the new realities of innovation. Instead of being a uniform process, innovation takes place in seven distinct 'games', focusing on market creation, market maintenance and innovator support. Rules for managing innovation are neither generic best practices that can be applied universally, nor narrow industry-specific recipes. Instead, distinct contexts call for specific strategies and rules to create and capture market value. Thus, innovation games are not predetermined sets of rules but leave ample room for creative competition and collaboration. Our approach urges business executives and academics to reassess the validity of conventional approaches, no matter how well established. Managers should worry far less about imitating industry best practices, and more about correctly gauging strategic issues. The first order of business for all players should be to turn potential negative-sum games into positive-sum games. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
 'The literature on marketing, operations management, and strategy has investigated the impacts of a firm’s supplier network structure and complexity on its financial, environmental, and innovation performance. However, our understanding of how the global supply chain complexities of a multinational enterprise (MNE) affect its international business performance (IBP) is limited. We draw on both the business network theory and information search literature to propose that the various complexity dimensions (e.g., horizontal, vertical, and spatial) of an MNE’s global supply chain have different influences on its subsequent IBP. We argue\xa0–\xa0and empirically validate\xa0–\xa0that collaboration, a network orchestration mechanism, enables an MNE to leverage the benefits of complex relationships. Using a dataset of 185 firms taken from multiple industries over 6 years, we show how such complexities have differential effects. In multiple post hoc analyses, we demonstrate how an MNE’s marketing intensity, the interconnectedness among its supply members, and its top management team (TMT)’s international experience all have unique impacts. This study contributes to the existing literature on global supply chain complexity by demonstrating how it can influence MNEs’ IBP. Moreover, we contribute to the strategic IBP literature by outlining effective global supply chain improvement strategies. © 2022, Academy of International Business.',
 'Building on agency theory and international business research, this paper explores how parent firm and subsidiary ownership factors affect FDI location decisions in emerging economies. Our analysis suggests that ownerships of block-shareholders in the parent firm (i.e., controlling family, non-family TMT members and institutional investors) and equity stake in a subsidiary owned by the parent company are positively associated with FDI location decisions in less-explored and risky areas. However, the effects of parent firm and subsidiary ownership factors may substitute for each other with respect to their integrated effect on dealing with risks associated with FDI location decisions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
 "Franchisee autonomy not only fosters system-wide adaptability and outlet owners' satisfaction but also raises the costs from agency problems present in franchisee-franchisor dyads. Advancing upon the understanding of agency issues involved in franchising, we test the argument that chains counterbalance the loss in control inherent to autonomy with relational governance mechanisms. The empirical results provided strong support for this presumption. In addition, and most notably, we found that the more relational governance becomes important, the weaker agents' incentives are aligned with the interests of the entire network. The moderating effects of five franchisee characteristics influencing goal congruencies were considered: multiunit ownership, age of the relationship, geographic distance, franchisee success, and the level of perceived intra-chain competition. Implications for chain management are provided. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",
 'We examine whether and to what extent female directors impact on ethical CG disclosure practices in a highly patriarchal sub-Saharan African country—Nigeria. Using hand-collected data for 108 listed firms from 2011 to 2017 (756 firm-year observations) and employing a system GMM model to control for endogeneity, we show that female directorship is positively and significantly associated with ethical CG disclosures. Our evidence suggests that, even within patriarchal societies where women face negative preconceptions and stereotypes about their leadership capabilities, firms with female directors disclose higher ethical CG practices than firms without such representation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of female directors in influencing ethical CG practices is positively enhanced by foreign directors and institutional shareholders but weakened in larger boardrooms. We also evidence that in firm-level configuration of CG bundle, female directorship is a substitute mechanism for leadership duality, larger boards, non-executive and foreign directorship. © 2023 The Author(s)',
 'An integration of agency theory and socialization models is developed and used to explain the types of governance and organizational structures associated with self-initiated subsidiary innovation. This theorizing suggests that: 1) The hub structure is the greatest user of behavior-based contracting and engenders the fewest self-initiated innovations; 2) The federation structure is the greatest user of outcome-based contracting and engenders the most self-initiated innovations, but these are primarily oriented to business level strategy rather than corporate; and, 3) The network structure is the greatest user of goal internalization and is the strongest generator of self-initiated innovations which are oriented to corporate-level strategy. The empirical evidence from extant studies of other researchers in the field is consistent with these propositions. Implications for management practice, research and theory are discussed in the paper. © 2007.',
 'Drawing from visionary leadership and strategy process research, we theorize and test the mechanism through which middle and lower-level managers’ visionary leadership affects their teams’ strategic commitment. The management literature extols the virtues of visionary leadership. In contrast to this positive stance, we reveal a dark side to visionary leadership. Our theoretical framework suggests that team manager visionary leadership harms team strategic consensus when the manager is not strategically aligned with the CEO, which in turn diminishes team commitment to the strategy. In contrast, when a team manager is strategically aligned with the CEO, team manager visionary leadership is positively related to team strategic consensus and subsequently to team strategic commitment. Data from 136 teams from two organizations support our moderated mediation model. A supplemental analysis of the content of strategic consensus and additional qualitative interviews with managers and employees in one of these organizations provide additional insights concerning the meaning of the theorized relations in practice. © The Author(s) 2018.',
 'Recently, the editors of Long Range Planning called for more phenomenon-based research. Such research focuses on identifying and reporting on new or recent phenomena of interest and relevance to management and organisation science. In this article, we explore the nature of phenomenon-based research and develop a research strategy that provides guidelines for researchers seeking to make this type of scientific inquiry rigorous and relevant. Phenomenon-based research establishes and describes the empirical facts and constructs that enable scientific inquiry to proceed. An account of the study of open source software development illustrates the research strategy. Rigorous phenomenon-based research tackles problems that are relevant to management practice and fall outside the scope of available theories. Phenomenon-based research also bridges epistemological and disciplinary divides because it unites diverse scholars around their shared interest in the phenomenon and their joint engagement in the research activities: identification, exploration, design, theorising and synthesis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.',
 'Accurate forecasts are vital for supporting the decisions of modern companies. Forecasters typically select the most appropriate statistical model for each time series. However, statistical models usually presume some data generation process while making strong assumptions about the errors. In this paper, we present a novel data-centric approach — ‘forecasting with cross-similarity’, which tackles model uncertainty in a model-free manner. Existing similarity-based methods focus on identifying similar patterns within the series, i.e., ‘self-similarity’. In contrast, we propose searching for similar patterns from a reference set, i.e., ‘cross-similarity’. Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar series are aggregated to obtain the forecasts of the target series. Building on the cross-learning concept, our approach allows the application of similarity-based forecasting on series with limited lengths. We evaluate the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it yields competitive accuracy in both points forecasts and prediction intervals. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Purpose: Entrepreneurship research in the context of developing countries has typically investigated the ways in which culture, politics or economic institutions prohibit or enable entrepreneurial activities using macro-level surveys and deductive designs. In contrast, the purpose of this paper is to take a micro-institutional perspective to study these three institutions influencing entrepreneurial activities in such a context. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on inductive, qualitative field data from a challenging institutional environment, Tanzania. This includes two focus groups, one with experts and one with entrepreneurs; and 24 individual interviews with entrepreneurs. Findings: Entrepreneurial activities in Tanzania are not constrained only by bureaucracy and arbitrary enforcement, access to capital, competition and consumer spending, but also by language barriers, negative media portrayals and gender disparity. In their favour, recent trade policy, opening up of borders and changing gender relations, has led to more opportunities, but just as important are traditional festivals, marital gift-giving and familial support. Entrepreneurs respond to institutional constraints in many creative ways, including undertaking entrepreneurial strategies, developing inner strength, joining associations, giving back to communities and skilfully managing relations with authorities. Originality/value: The fine-grained discussion of the findings of this study specifically contributes to theory by illustrating the constraining and enabling role of under-represented institutions, such as festivals and marriages, as well as entrepreneurial creative responses that define everyday entrepreneurial life in a developing country. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.',
 'Increasing corporate risk-taking is crucial for family businesses that tend to be averse to the loss of socioemotional wealth. This study expands research on non-family shareholder governance by exploring the role of non-family shareholders in influencing the strategic decisions of family businesses. We find that the ownership structure and board participation associated with non-family shareholder governance can enhance corporate risk-taking by weakening family control and strengthening inheritance intention. Furthermore, family style and institutional efficiency can optimize the impact of the mechanisms of non-family shareholder governance and corporate risk-taking. Non-family ownership and directors appointed by non-family shareholders exert a cross effect. Compared with non-family ownership, non-family shareholders who are free to participate in corporate governance through ownership and the appointment of directors can better help family businesses improve their corporate risk-taking. Compared with foreign shareholders and institutional investors, the heterogeneous checks and balances of state and private shareholders can effectively enhance corporate risk-taking. Corporate risk-taking can strengthen the long-term orientation of family businesses. This positive relationship is more significant when the level of non-family shareholder governance is higher than when it is lower. Our conclusions broaden the understanding of the corporate risk-taking behavior of family businesses from the perspective of non-family shareholder governance. As such, they shed light on how to enhance the long-term orientation of family businesses. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Over the past years, media coverage of firms has received significant scholarly attention. However, the resulting literature is spread across multiple disciplines and, therefore, varies with regard to its theoretical underpinnings and contextual settings. This makes it challenging for scholars to understand the contributions of this literature, to identify areas of inquiry, and to develop an encompassing research agenda. In this review, we address these issues by surveying the diverse literature on media coverage of firms to develop an integrative framework of the antecedents and consequences of media coverage that highlights paths for future research. Specifically, we identify the three theoretical perspectives—economic, institutional, and social-psychological—that the literature generally assumes on the news media. In addition, we highlight differences between strategy, finance, governance, and crisis contexts and review results from articles examining media coverage of firms in aggregate. In each context, we identify the primary functions of the news media as well as antecedents and consequences of media coverage. We proceed to develop an integrative framework for media coverage of firms by building on these findings and by examining the empirical methods used to measure media coverage, particularly regarding the measurement of specific coverage attributes. We highlight the gaps in current knowledge that our framework exposes and derive opportunities for future research that can further scholars’ and practitioners’ understanding of firm media coverage. © The Author(s) 2019.',
 'We document the role of entrepreneurial founder and venture capital (VC) partner co-ethnicity in shaping investment relationships. Co-ethnicity increases the likelihood that a VC firm invests in a company. Conditional on investment, co-ethnicity strengthens the degree of involvement by raising the likelihood of VC board of director involvement and increasing the size and scope of investment. These results are consistent with trust and social-network based mechanisms. Shared ethnicity in our sample is associated with worse investment outcomes as measured by investment liquidity, however, which our results suggest might stem from looser screening and/or corporate governance. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Shareholder investment horizons have a significant impact on say-on-pay voting patterns. Short-term investors are more likely to avoid expressing opinion on executive pay proposals by casting an abstaining vote. They vote against board proposals on pay only in cases where the CEO already receives excessive pay levels. In contrast, long-term investors typically cast favourable votes. According to our findings, this is due to effective monitoring rather than collusion with the management. Overall, investor heterogeneity in terms of investment horizons helps explain say-on-pay voting, in particular the low levels of say-on-pay dissent, which have recently raised questions over the efficiency of this corporate governance mechanism. © 2016 British Academy of Management',
 'This study combines the resource-based view of the firms and region-based view of the strategy (i.e., a 2R-based view) to shed light on the crucial roles of firm-specific resources and region-specific heterogeneity within the context of China, a large emerging economy. The study explains the variations in internationalization levels among service multinational enterprises (MNEs). Based on a large sample analysis of Chinese service MNEs, our findings demonstrate that MNEs with good cost efficiency and few intangible resources exhibit great propensity for international expansion, thereby achieving high internationalization level. Chinese service MNEs located in a coastal region or a region with well-developed institutional environments achieve high internationalization level as well. These findings support a U-shaped relationship between the internationalization of service MNEs and their performance. Our research findings confirm our predictions from the 2R-based view, which provides valuable insight into the regional development and international strategy of MNEs from emerging economies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.',
 "A call has recently been made for scholarly research aimed at understanding how family-owned firms can enhance their performance. Only a handful of studies have hitherto examined the capabilities of such firms in relation to innovation-related outcomes. In addition to this gap, past studies have examined either the mediation or moderation model, which has not fully elucidated the essence of how these firms can improve their new product development performance. By addressing these critical gaps by using survey data collected from 253 family-owned small-medium enterprises (SMEs) based in the UAE, we found that market sensing capabilities mediate the influence of socio-emotional wealth on new product performance.

 'This paper contributes to the growing research about Human Resource Management (HRM) by examining the interrelationships between High Performance Work System (HPWS) and their effects on firm performance in the hotel industry. Recent studies stress the need to delve deeper into this link considering the role that may be played by certain dynamic capabilities as mediating variables (Patel, Messersmith, & Lepak, 2013; Prieto-Pastor & Martin-Perez, 2014). The current study proposes a multiple mediating model and tests the mediation. More specifically, this research establishes that human resource flexibility (HRF) and organizational ambidexterity (OA) play a mediating role in the HPWS-performance relationship. A variance-based structural equation modeling (Partial Least Squares) has been applied to a sample of Spanish hotel firms. The results obtained support the mediation hypotheses according to which HRF and OA play a critical mediating role in the HPWS-performance relationship. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.',
 "Purpose: The paper aims to examine the nature and scale of the sustainability value of car sharing and to identify, through consumer analysis, the contextual and consumer factors of success of car subscription as a business model. Design/methodology/approach: The study evaluates the car sharing model against the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations in 2019. Individual interviews were performed for preliminary understanding of the factors affecting consumers' choices. Subsequently, through two phases of data collection, factor analysis and path model analysis were performed to identify and confirm latent factors. Consumer market segmentation was performed using cluster analysis. Findings: Car sharing was found to have an overall positive net impact, with certain potential negative dimensions. Willingness, financial affordability, location and experience were identified as the key factors of consumers opting for car subscriptions. The findings further highlight the significant business potentialities of car subscription in India, consequent also to consumers' attitudes toward car ownership. Practical implications: The research has substantial implications for both society and business, with the former being presented with an innovative sustainable means of transportation, and the latter with the elements of success of an entrepreneurial business model to support the former. Originality/value: The study is a pioneer in objectively evaluating and prescribing positive social and business value creation for and through car subscription in India, based on consumer analysis. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
 "We set out to investigate how organizations respond to the variety of requirements as experienced in their pluralizing institutional environments. We found that, in addition to acquiescence and compromise, Dutch vocational education and training (VET) organizations predominantly respond with cooperation and coordination strategies. Extensive multistage qualitative data analysis of 26 semi-structured in-depth interviews with management team (MT) members showed that cooperation and coordination are viable and effective response strategies to face a divergent and highly differentiated set of sometimes-conflicting institutional requirements. Our study advances understanding of how organizations deploy strategic choice to arrive at their strategic responses. It offers organizational leaders, legislators, policymakers, and other constituents' insights into complex reality of how contemporary organizations actually relate to and act in their pluralizing institutional environments. © 2023 The Authors.

 'We examine the influence of CEO equity-based compensation on strategic risk taking by the firm. Building off the Behavioral Agency Model, Agency Theory, and Prospect Theory, we develop arguments about when equity-based compensation elements will increase or decrease executive risk propensity and, in turn, strategic risk taking. Incorporating a behavioral perspective into our models of incentive alignment provides us with new and potentially more accurate predictions about how individual elements of CEO pay will influence risk selection, as well as how equity compensation interacts with cash compensation and with other factors to influence risk preferences. In general, this study provides evidence that CEO equity-based compensation significantly influences strategic risk, but that this influence is more nuanced and complex than conventional treatments of executive compensation assume. In particular, we find that different forms of equity-based pay exhibit dissimilar influences on strategic risk and that their influence changes as their value and vesting status change. Second, we find that cash-based forms of pay moderate the incentive properties of equity-based pay, indicating that cash-based pay may affect how executives perceive risks associated with equity pay. Finally, we find that stock price volatility and board actions each also moderate the incentive effects of equity-based pay. In sum, our results argue for increased recognition of a behavioral perspective on executive compensation and greater precision in how we measure and model the incentive alignment properties of CEO compensation. © 2008 INFORMS.',
 'This article studies innovation in family firms, filling in some gaps in existent literature. The research addresses the idea of shifting leadership, different mechanisms of facilitating communication, and the importance to the firm of technical progress, linking each to innovation. Shifting leadership is addressed through the longitudinal design. Communication mechanisms are monitored through two constructs: scope of information and timeliness of information. Technical progress is included in an environmental uncertainty factor technoeconomic uncertainty. The findings suggest that linkages between established family firms and innovation may be substantially stronger than currently assumed by many. © 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.',
 "We study competitive interactions between Intel and Microsoft, two producers of complementary products. In a system of complements, like the PC, the value of the final product depends on how well the different components work together. This, in turn, depends on the firms' investment in complementary R&D. We ask whether Intel and Microsoft will want to cooperate and make the final product as valuable as possible. Contrary to the popular view that two tight complements will generally have well aligned incentives, we demonstrate that natural conflicts emerge over pricing, the timing of new product releases, and who captures the greatest value at different phases of product generations. © 2007 INFORMS.",
 'Given the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence technologies in the healthcare industry, efficient healthcare delivery has become increasingly important. In creating a patient-centered and engaging technology, the omnichannel healthcare model has expanded to allow consumers access to online health communities, including physician-led online medical teams (OMTs). To help ensure the continued growth of this emerging omnichannel touchpoint, we develop a three-level theoretical model using a combination of hierarchical linear modeling and panel data identification to analyze a large-scale longitudinal dataset consisting of 2,185 physicians across 1,400 OMTs. In line with self-determination theory, we identify physician-level (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic) and team-level (i.e., social interaction ties) motivational drivers of physician engagement, along with managerially relevant boundary conditions. Based on our findings, we suggest a multi-level strategy for ensuring the continued growth and success of OMTs in facilitating value co-creation between health providers and patients. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.',
 'While the importance of top management teams in the formation and development of new ventures is well recognised, their impact on the rapid internationalization of such firms remains relatively under-researched. This article presents the findings of a cross-national study conducted in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand that demonstrate the significant impact that such teams have in creating the core internal capabilities and leveraging the external resources required for rapid and dedicated internationalization. The need to augment the management team in order to address key resource or knowledge gaps and/or to expand international networks is also evident among many firms, as is the impact of changes in team structures on business strategy and internationalization. Directions for future research and implications for public policy in support of rapidly internationalizing small firms are presented and discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.',
 "The Asian economic crisis forced Korea's large business groups to curtail their overextended business operations by reducing the number of their affiliated firms. Building on major theories of organizational change and restructuring, we investigate the strategic rationale behind the chaebols' two key decisions for their individual business units - whether and if so how to eliminate them. We also review the expansion activities and business structures of surviving groups in the post-crisis period, to evaluate the enduring impact of the Asian crisis on the management of the chaebols. Our analysis suggests that Korean business groups have been transformed into more competitive management systems. The system may not only enable subunits to share the group's core competencies more efficiently to explore potential synergies, but also would help ensure their long-run viability by balancing exploitation and exploration activities. Based on this observation, we present five lessons for managers in business groups and diversified companies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
 'This paper proposes a framework for understanding location distance and governance model choice in the business process outsourcing (BPO) decision. Much of the current international business (IB) literature employs location-specific factors alone to explain the BPO decision, and this literature is dominated by studies of the offshore location option, with limited attention given to the local and nearshore location distance options as alternatives to offshoring. The framework proposed here was developed from integrating firm-level and process-level factors with location attractiveness factors, and undertaking in-depth case study analysis of a number of German companies. The findings highlight the value of integrating firm-level and process-level factors with location attractiveness factors to understand location distance and governance model choice in the BPO decision, and support those who have argued that existing frameworks in this area cannot fully explain the complexities of the BPO decision. Moreover, the findings provide important insights into how these factors interact to influence location distance and governance model choice. The proposed BPO framework also provides a useful basis for practical prescription. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Recent reviews of global strategy research have documented a number of top contributors based on the number of their publications. However, no citation analysis has been conducted to ascertain the impact and influence of this research. In response, we have conducted the first ever citation analysis of 393 global strategy articles in nine leading journals published during the 1990s. Our findings identify the 25 most cited articles in the nine journals, the top 40 authors who publish these most cited articles, and the most cited articles in each of the 16 categories (subfields) of global strategy research. We also find that there is relatively little correlation between the set of 30 most prolific authors identified by Lu [Lu, J.W., 2003. The evolving contributions in international strategic management research. Journal of International Management, 9, 193-213.] and our set of 40 most cited authors. Among the 30 most prolific contributors, only eight (27%) have authored one of the top 25 most cited articles.

 "One important effect of the increasing integration of the world economy is the rising importance of possibilities to offshore and outsource value-creating activities. In many industries, firms are able to disaggregate their value chains into smaller parts. This process allows for a less path-dependent approach to the firm's ideal location profile (through offshoring and relocation) and control strategies (through outsourcing). This article argues that optimal decisions regarding individual processes recognize the linkages of these processes with the firm's entire value chain. The article explores the magnitude, sequence, and dynamics of interdependent decisions regarding the location and control of various parts of the value chain. By using case illustrations from the mobile handset and financial services industries, this article provides a novel perspective on the disintegration, mobility, and reintegration of value chain activities in a global context. © 2010 The Authors.

 "Research suggests that a CEO may have more influence in the context of small entrepreneurial firms, but it is still unclear how a company's chief executive facilitates strategic decision-making. Little is known about the ways in which these individuals build strategic capabilities, such as the capacity to adapt to changing environments. This study addresses these issues and develops a model indicating that transformational leadership facilitates behavioural integration and comprehensiveness in the decision process among members of the top management team (TMT), which in turn enhances organizational capacity to adapt to environmental changes. Survey results shed light on the complex way in which CEOs facilitate processes within the TMT and enhance small entrepreneurial firms’ capacity to adapt, thereby increasing their viability. This study contributes to the literatures on Upper Echelon Theory, strategic decision-making, and dynamic capabilities by shedding light on the ways in which transformational leaders influence behavioural and decision-making processes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies",
 'Increasingly, social enterprises are relying on collaboration with partners to tackle the resource constraints that they face. In this research we focus on the strategy of bricolage to explore whether and how the different types of partner becoming involved may impact on the mission of social enterprises. Grounded in resource dependency and transaction cost theories, we explore how power asymmetry and the nature of involvement may impact on the outcomes of bricolage. Our findings demonstrate that in the more integrated relationships with high power asymmetry, more instances of mission drift might be observed compared to when social enterprises develop the more collaborative or complementary nature of partnerships with symmetrical power dependency, or when the partners’ involvements are mainly transaction-based. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',
 "This article discusses the questions and issues that prompted the founding of the Diana Project, a multi-university research program aimed at identifying factors that support and enable high growth in women-led ventures. Despite the fact that women business owners comprise a significant portion of the economy, women face challenges in acquiring the resources needed to expand their businesses. This article details both the myths and realities associated with women's entrepreneurship in their quest for growth. In particular, we examine the strategies that women entrepreneurs use to position their firms for growth, especially those strategies related to growth capital. Our results show that women seeking venture capital (VC) have degrees, graduate degrees, and experience that should not preclude them from obtaining financing. We also found that even though women-led businesses are frequently clustered in industries less attractive to financiers, women seeking equity funding are in the appropriate industries. Further, women spend a considerable amount of time using both formal and informal networks in their search for capital and in seeking capital. Because of the importance of the VC industry as a provider of growth capital and its reliance on its network for investment referrals, we also examined the participation and role of women as decision-makers in industry. Women's participation in the VC industry has not kept pace with industry growth, and women have exited the industry at a faster rate than men, thus creating a significant barrier for women entrepreneurs in that it is less likely that their networks will overlap with the financial supplier networks, despite any effort they may expend networking and seeking capital. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",
 'What can strategic management research do to help to make sense of the COVID-19 disruption, and what are the implications of the disruption for the strategy field? I argue that among the streams in strategy research, behavioral strategy is uniquely situated in terms of providing a psychologically based interpretive lens that could lend great insight into decision making in extreme conditions. However, the disruption also points to weakness in current behavioral strategy thinking, notably with respect to the role of models vis-à-vis judgment in strategic decision making, the deeply social (political, institutional) nature of strategy making, and the treatment of fundamental uncertainty. © The Author(s) 2020.',
 "Consumers become satiated with a product when purchasing too much too quickly. How much is too much and how quickly is too quickly depends on the characteristics of the product relative to the time interval between consumption periods. Knowing that, consumers allocate their budget to products that generate less satiation effects. Retailers should then choose to sell products that induce minimal satiation, but usually this is operationally more costly. To study this trade-off, we provide an analytical model based on utility theory that relates customer consumption to price and satiation, in the context of multiple competing retailers. We determine the purchasing pattern over time and provide an explicit expression to determine the consumption level in steady state. We derive market shares and show that they take the form of an attraction model in which the attractiveness depends on price and product satiation. We use this to analyze the competition between firms that maximize long-term average profit. We characterize the equilibrium under three scenarios: (i) price-only competition, (ii) product-only competition, and (iii) price and product competition. The results reveal the interplay between a key marketing lever (price) and the firm's ability to offer products that generate less satiation. In particular, we show that when a firm becomes more efficient at reducing satiation, its competitor may benefit if competition is on product only, but not if it is on price and product. We also find that when satiation effects are not managed, a firm's profit may be significantly reduced while a strategic competitor can largely benefit. © 2012 INFORMS.",
 'This research aims to address consumers’ referral intention-behavior inconsistency when responding to entrepreneurs who explicitly position themselves as underdogs. In three experiments with referral behavioral outcomes associated with real new ventures, we identify consumers’ power states as a critical moderator and a viable solution to help enhance the correspondence between referral intention and behavior. Specifically, by altering consumers’ power perceptions (Studies 1 and 2) and by offering empowerment strategies via marketing campaigns (Study 3), consumers with a high sense of power are more likely to translate their referral intention for the underdog entrepreneurial endeavor into referral behavior, compared with those with a low sense of power. This research, therefore, provides theoretical, managerial, and organizational insights into how underdog entrepreneurs can effectively employ and benefit from their unique adversity in positioning themselves in the marketplace to pursue entrepreneurial success. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.',
 "This study revisits the theory, data, and analysis in Hervas-Oliver and Sempere-Ripoll (2014) and applies fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA) to organizational innovation effects and the influence on them of technological innovations.

Using fuzzy set comparative qualitative analysis (fs/QCA) on Hervas-Oliver and Sempere-Ripoll's (2014) 9,369 organizational innovators, the present study offers more complex and nuanced antecedent conditions relating to organizational innovation beyond Hervas-Oliver and Sempere-Ripoll (2014) analysis based on traditional multiple regression symmetric method. This present study finds different sufficient configurations or combinations of causal antecedent conditions which improve the importance of organizational innovation effects.

 "Previous research has established a link between the debt component of capital structure and managers making risky decisions. Literature in finance and strategy has explored the role of debt and concluded that increases in debt focus managerial decision making on short-term financial goals, suggesting that increases in debt might also lead to managers making decisions that put operational workers and the firm at long-term risk.\xa0Therefore this research explores if the strategic choice of a firm's level of debt predicts the firm's likelihood of breaching safety regulations. Furthermore, this study explores the short- and long-term financial implications of breaching safety regulations. Secondary safety and financial data collected in the United Kingdom is used to answer the research questions using logistic models and an event study. The results show that decisions on debt are a significant predictor of a firm's likelihood of breaching safety regulation and that breaching safety regulation harms long-term financial performance. Strategic decisions on debt levels lead to further decisions that place the workforce and profitability of the firm at risk. © 2018 Decision Sciences Institute",
 'Normally, contractual conceptions of intergenerational justice regard the responsibility held by each generation as symmetrical. This article argues that the late modern society has created an asymmetry because of its unprecendented instrumental and destructive capacity. Historically unique risks such as thermonuclear destruction, global ecological deprivation, and resource depletion all point at this asymmetry and unequal distribution of responsibility between generations. Extending one contractual device used by John Rawls in line with what Brian Barry has suggested, this article analyzes the roots of the asymmetry and presents two political strategies to end it. The first strategy resembles the traditional deep ecological programme whereas the second holds an imaginative vision of a human future in space. Both strategies seek to reduce the influence present generations exercise on the level of opportunity available to future generations. The key normative argument is that intergenerational justice requires spatial and temporal limits on political action. © 2006 Sage Publications.',
 'The interdisciplinary nature of buyer-supplier relationships, whose related concepts have been presented in studies with contributions from supply chain management, industrial marketing, and strategy, has hindered our knowledge of the factors involved in buyer-supplier relationships. Although these factors have been investigated with different approaches and theories, the sustainability and resiliency factors involved in the buyer-supplier relationship requires further clarification. Therefore, this study aims to analyze buyer-supplier relationships and classify the factors involved using a systematic literature review. By synthesizing and categorizing the findings of 187 selected articles, using a neural network model, applying a force field analysis, an exploration-exploitation strategy, and a focus group, the paper presents an integrative framework for buyer-supplier relationships. This framework consists of six classes, including Relationship Quality as the central category of the framework, Driving Forces, Restraining Forces, Exploration Factors, Exploitation Factors, and Outcomes. Moreover, a classification of the factors involved in buyer-supplier relationships through sustainability and resilience approaches was presented. In this paper, the positive and dark sides of the relationship were covered simultaneously, and directions for future research were provided. © 2023',
 'This study examines the role of strengthened patent examination system in shaping firms’ innovation activities. We find that strengthening patent examination system discourages the strategic use of patents and stimulates efforts toward substantive innovation that develops novel technologies. We identify two boundary conditions, namely technology intensity and ownership type, which regulate the impact of the strengthened patent examination system on firms’ innovation strategies. We further reveal that the post-reform changes in corporate innovation strategies lead to an improvement in the overall quality of innovation output, which results in improved firm financial performance. This study contributes to the research on the impact of patent system changes on innovation, and also the research on firm patenting trends by linking to standards of patent examination.

 'Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between the development of academic spin-offs (ASOs) and the type of financing involved, by considering three research questions: How do ASOs differ in terms of financing? To what extent and for what reasons do ASOs differ in their financing? How do business and growth models dictate the selection of different sorts of financing arrangement? Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a grounded-theory, qualitative approach based on 39 Spanish ASOs. Findings: There is a heterogeneity of ASO financing, and the selection of financial resources is related to the business and growth model of the ASO. Furthermore, there are some critical junctures for financing within each group of ASOs. Research limitations/implications: The study advances the understanding of the determinants of ASOs, specifically with respect to financing, business models and growth orientation. The Spanish context used here may not permit the global generalisation of the results; nevertheless, this study is a response to calls to consider the effect of regional context on ASOs. Practical implications: Knowing the heterogeneity of ASOs in terms of financing and how business and growth models determines the selection of distinct financing sources help financial planning, investment decisions and the design of programmes and policies, which can be relevant for both ASOs and their stakeholders (investors, universities and governments). Originality/value: This study provides a comprehensive view of ASO financing, confirming a heterogeneity, not only in terms of financing but also in some critical junctures that presage a change from one type of financing to another. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.',
 "The relationship between internationalization and performance has attracted researchers' attention for more than 40 years, producing contradictory results. Research on emerging-market (EM) multinationals' performance has not added much clarity to the issue. Although contingency theory is widely applied in management research to explain superior organizational performance as a direct result of a 'fit' between structure, strategy, and environment, there has been little effort in extending the notion of strategy-structure-environment fit to include internationalization. We address this limitation by offering a comprehensive analysis of Russian internationalized firms' performance, which reflects the complexity of strategic and structural changes that Russian firms make during internationalization. We use survey data on 213 predominantly private and mature firms to examine whether the alignment of a multitude of strategic and structural choices in a specific context matters for subsequent performance. We apply a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) and find several distinct types of 'fit' that positively affect Russian internationalized firms' performance.

 "Recent contributions to the organizational literature see the radical subjectivist and disequilibrium framework of Ludwig Lachmann as providing a suitable foundation for strategic entrepreneurial studies, in that his approach seeks independence from conventional equilibrium-based reasoning. In a Lachmannian spirit, this article suggests that strategizing can fruitfully be viewed as choices made by the entrepreneur in terms of the organization's constituent resources, activities and routines together with their recombinations and complexifications. Cast in a general, disequilibrium setting, the strategic goals that guide the organizational entrepreneur's strategizing can be formulated in terms of the construction and capture of resource complementarities, the pursuit of increasing returns through activities reconfiguration, and the generation of learning and dynamic capabilities through reconfiguration of routines. Once formulated in this way, the strategizing issues may be seen to make sense not just in the comparative static and imperfect equilibrium frameworks within which they have hitherto been posed, but in a more general dynamic and disequilibrium setting that corresponds to the real conditions in which firms are required to make entrepreneurial decisions. The simplified framework offers some hope for overcoming the balkanization of management scholarship that is so widely deplored. © The Author(s), 2010.",
 'Whereas extant theorizing on interorganizational relational dynamics has highlighted the importance of between-partner differences, we shift attention to within-partner differences. We explore how internal fragmentation—that is, the existence of multiple coalitions within a partner organization, each with different interests and perspectives—influences the evolution of relational characteristics in interorganizational relationships. Based on a longitudinal case study of a dyadic strategic alliance, we develop a process model, describing how internal fragmentation within one of the partner organizations can lead to a counterintuitive relational pattern—namely, “dual relational dynamics”—where decision makers of both partners continue renewing their formal commitments, while simultaneously experiencing negative trust dynamics. We show that the existence of different belief systems within one partner organization can lead to a politically charged process, wherein different coalitions within this organization frame and act upon interorganizational events in different ways. This politically charged process can fuel both hope and disappointment among decision makers of both partner organizations, leading to dual relational dynamics. Our findings contribute by advocating a political perspective on interorganizational relationships. We also demonstrate the relevance of this political perspective by showing how it challenges the dominant notion of interorganizational relational dynamics as reinforcing spirals. r Academy of Management Journal',
 'This article reviews scholarship dealing with the notion of “boundary work,” defined as purposeful individual and collective effort to influence the social, symbolic, material, or temporal boundaries, demarcations; and distinctions affecting groups, occupations, and organizations. We identify and explore the implications of three conceptually distinct but interrelated forms of boundary work emerging from the literature. Competitive boundary work involves mobilizing boundaries to establish some kind of advantage over others. In contrast, collaborative boundary work is concerned with aligning boundaries to enable collaboration. Finally, configurational boundary work involves manipulating patterns of differentiation and integration among groups to ensure that certain activities are brought together, whereas others are kept apart, orienting the domains of competition and collaboration. We argue that the notion of boundary work can contribute to the development of a uniquely processual view of organizational design as open-ended, and continually becoming, an orientation with significant future potential for understanding novel forms of organizing, and for integrating agency, power dynamics, materiality, and temporality into the study of organizing. © Academy of Management Annals.',
 'Despite the increasing attention Global Marketing Strategy (GMS) is receiving in the academic literature, researchers have paid relatively little attention to whether markets can be segmented cross-nationally. Drawing on GMS theory, this study predicts the existence of stable cross-market segments in the sportswear industry. Surveying a cross-national group of consumers from Austria, China, South Korea, and the United States regarding their lifestyle preferences, the study collected data on demographics, evaluative attributes, and purchase patterns, garnering a total of 1031 usable questionnaires from the four nations. Results of a factor analysis identify eight lifestyle factors that can be used to help segment sportswear consumers. A follow-up cluster analysis indicates four psychographic segments cut across cultural boundaries: Fashion Leaders, Conspicuous Fashion Consumers, Sensational Seekers, and Sociable Followers. The study also investigates whether the four segments can be targeted separately and finds that they do, indeed, present different characteristics. The findings support the existence of similarities across the world fashion markets that allow the sportswear industry to target market segments based on the theoretical framework. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.',

As individual studies have started to investigate the different value processes in servitization and the effects they have on the manufacturers' wider context, it becomes important to consolidate prior research and develop an integrative understanding of value in servitization. The present study is based on a systematic review of the servitization literature, expanding the research scope from a dyadic to a triadic, network and system level of analysis. The study creates a value architecture framework which establishes a comprehensive understanding of value in servitization, with implications for future servitization theory building and strategy development. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",
 'This article builds a model to answer a critical but unsolved research question: What are the resources and/or the resource portfolio firms need to achieve the performance implications of entrepreneurial strategy making (ESM)? Based on a survey of Chinese firms, we find that ESM has a significant positive influence on firm performance. In addition, to accomplish the performance implications of ESM, firms need both flexible employed resources and unabsorbed slack, while just one of them does not work. Thus, a resource portfolio composed of high flexible employed resources and unabsorbed slack is the appropriate one to achieve the value of ESM. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.',
 "Motivated by real examples that run contrary to conventional wisdom, we examine how firms organize themselves to strategize well. Interactions among decisions make strategizing difficult. They raise the spectre that a firm's strategizing efforts will get stuck in a web of conflicting constraints prematurely, before managers explore a wide enough range of possibilities. A key role of organizing is to free strategizing efforts and encourage broad search. At the same time, organizing must ensure that strategizing efforts are stabilized once the firm discovers an effective set of choices. The need to balance search and stability, we argue, is a central challenge of organizing. We explore this challenge with an agent-based simulation of firms that organize to strategize in the face of interactions. The results shed light on our counterintuitive examples. They show why and when firms may benefit from unnecessary overlap between departments; how and when firms can increase firm-wide search by reining in the search efforts of individual managers; and how and when a change in organizational structure - e.g., a shift from decentralization to integration - may reflect an effective sequence of organizing, rather than a reversal of early mistakes. The disparate examples share an underlying logic. The unnecessary overlap, the reining-in of managers, the period of decentralization - all can be seen as organizational mechanisms that help ensure the broad, early search that a firm needs when interactions among strategic decisions raise the danger of locking-in on a strategy prematurely. © 2006.",
 "The environmental movement has often contested and reshaped scientific knowledge to achieve its goals. However, theorists have yet to account for this social movement tactic. This research uses a case study of the anti-dam movement in Brazil, with particular reference to three instances of anti-dam activism across the country, to delineate how scientization of the state motivates environmental movements to contest science. It uses Jurgen Habermas's theory of communicative action to explicate how instrumental and communicative claims are deliberated on in collaborations between activists and researchers, resulting in new scientific conceptualizations. These results are then translated to the public through innovative movement frames. This research helps situate communicative action as a social movement strategy important in a global knowledge society. © 2006 Sage Publications.",
 "Middle managers are critical in talent management practice. Yet, their commitment to enacting organisational strategies and policies is often limited given their multiplicity of responsibilities and tasks beyond talent management. Taking a paradox lens and a multi-stakeholder perspective, we draw from 147 interviews with middle managers, HR leaders and talents to unpack two key paradoxes when managing talent: a short-term–long-term paradox and a function–organisation paradox. Our research reveals a range of defensive and proactive responses to these paradoxes, which leads us to develop a typology of middle manager approaches navigating paradoxes in talent management. This typology depicts features, tensions and examples of middle managers' approach to managing talent. We introduce the extent of intradepartmental involvement and interdepartmental collaboration as key features and illustrate spatial and temporal tensions underlying paradoxes. We conclude with implications of the (in)effective management of paradoxes in a talent context. © 2023 The Authors.

 'Fashion firms have transferred their manufacturing processes to Asia, seeking minimum labor costs, supported by the academic literature’s proposals for alternative supply chain configurations to maximize profits. Fashion industry has undergone public analysis, facing demands for greater transparency about environmental and social sustainability. The growing public awareness of sustainability issues has led firms to declare their commitment to sustainable resources, but few changes have been registered. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe listed technological innovation as a key tool for making the fashion industry transparent and traceable regarding sustainability and circularity. The research and responsible innovation framework indicate appropriate ways to manage innovation from a responsible and ethical perspective, according to ethical corporate behaviour (ECB), particularly in the industries characterized by productive phases processed in more countries, such as the fashion industry. However, the linkages between responsible innovation, ECB towards innovative and sustainable business models, and their conceptualization, are still unclear in the fashion industry, achieving the goals included in the UN 2030 Agenda. This study draws on bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature on 114 articles published between 1990 and 2021 allows to identify the above issues in the research domains, and outline the evolutionary trajectories, as well as to explore the literary corpus about responsible innovation (RI) in the ethical corporate behaviour (ECB) of the fashion industry and its Asian suppliers. The results highlight that fashion brands strive to develop RI and ECB along their supply chain. Still, the misalignment of corporate ethics and cultural values represents a significant obstacle to the adoption of business models, especially to achieve the goals of UN 2030 Agenda. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that discusses RI as enabling driver in the ECB for fashion companies also defining a future research agenda including RI, ECB, iSBMs towards SDGs. © 2022, The Author(s).',

We find that a practice area is less likely to hire attorneys from a rival practice area when the leaders of the two practice areas attended the same law school at the same time, our proxy for the presence of an affiliation tie. The negative relationship is stronger for hiring higher-ranked attorneys, and it is driven by practice leaders from the same law school class. Exploiting appointments of new practice leaders, we find a sharp and immediate decline in interorganizational mobility following an appointment that creates an affiliation tie between the leadership of the practice areas. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that job seekers’ preferences drive the results, we conclude that rival managers’ ties deserve further scrutiny because they might limit the outside employment opportunities of their subordinates. © 2021 INFORMS',
 'We apply insights from organizational behavior, psychology, and sociology to make the case that the community in which a firm is embedded is a valuable, rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable resource that holds potential as a source of sustained competitive advantage. First, we review several key principles of the resource-based view (RBV) and show how they apply to community as a strategic resource, incorporating prior work that simultaneously addresses communities and RBV. Next, we juxtapose pairs of firms in the same industries, comparing those that have embraced this strategy with those that have not, demonstrating the superior sustainability of the firms that consider community as a strategic resource. Finally, we conclude with thoughts as to a future research agenda that allows for an expansion of the concept of resources to further the development of RBV, the firms that apply it, and the communities in which they are embedded. In doing so, we demonstrate how expanding RBV to incorporate the community as strategic resource contributes to managerial theory, research, and practice. © The Author(s) 2021.',
 'The integration–performance link created during post-acquisition integration has defied satisfactory theoretical explanation. To address this gap, we conduct a functional analysis to explore the intermediating mechanisms between the level of integration – which represents the extent of the target firm’s integration with the acquirer – and acquisition performance. We use six in-depth acquisition case studies in the medical technology industry to develop an integrated model with which to untangle the integration–performance link. First, our model connects the level of integration to specific functional integration strategies, which refer to the approaches acquirers employ to manage functional resources. Second, we identify value creation and value leakage as the two routes through which functional integration strategies impact acquisition performance. Finally, we propose two qualitative measures of acquisition performance: value gap and time delay. Our study suggests that a functional analysis of the integration–performance link may help resolve long-standing conflicts within the literature. © 2020 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
 'Due to their direct and indirect network effects, platform firms play a significant role in the global economy. These firms have disrupted the innovation value chain by creating and capturing value from the scaling up of their business activities. Despite the role they play in disruptive innovation, we know relatively little about the ways in which platform firms engage with their institutional and other stakeholders through non-market corporate political activities and social strategies. This special issue on ‘non-market strategies and disruptive innovation in the platform economy’ aims to contribute to the current literature which has examined the rise of platform firms and their value creation. It also intends to capture drivers of value creation by drawing insights from the non-market strategies literature developed in the context of traditional firms. This introductory article and the papers included in this special issue provide important insights into non-market strategies and platform firms, and highlight potential topics suited for future research. © 2023 The Authors',
 'Companies and managers are apt to forget information, yet classic game theory analysis assumes that all players have perfect recall. This paper expands the literature by examining how introducing forgetfulness into a multiplayer game-theoretic framework can help or hinder cooperative behavior. We find that forgetfulness impacts the ability of firms to cooperate in countervailing directions. On one hand, forgetfulness can diminish the ability to punish deviators, making cooperation more difficult. On the other hand, under some conditions forgetfulness can make meting out severe punishments-even below-(stage) minimax punishments-credible and decrease the ability for players to effectively deviate, facilitating cooperation even in circumstances where cooperation cannot be sustained under perfect recall. We apply our model to a number of strategic games that commonly appear in the literature.© 2011 INFORMS.',
 'We examine the impact of institutional ownership and product market competition on earnings management (both accrual-based and real) using data from non-financial firms in 41 countries around the world for the period 1995–2016. Overall all, we document an asymmetry in the role institutional ownership and product market competition play in curbing accrual vis-à-vis real earnings management. After controlling for firm-level determinants of earnings management documented by prior research, industry and country indicator variables, we find robust evidence (no evidence) that accrual (real) earnings management increases (is associated) with percentage of institutional ownership. While institutional ownership appears to have no effect on real earnings management, it significantly accentuates accrual earnings management. We also find that product market competition is positively associated with accrual earnings management, though statistically significantly only when the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) proxy is used. Lastly, product market competition is significantly negatively associated with real earnings management, using two of the three proxies of product market competition. Only when we use the inverse of number of firms in an industry (NUMB) do we find a positive association between product market competition and real earnings management. Product market competition appears to accentuate accrual but attenuate real earnings management. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.',
 "This paper examines renewable energy (RE) investment and the role of a country's legal system in shaping investment decisions.\xa0Analysing data from 236 renewable energy companies between 2000 and 2017 across the world, our study establishes that\xa0those in a common law system are more responsive to growth opportunities in RE investment, while facing greater financial constraints than their counterparts in civil law systems.\xa0Our study demonstrates that the global imbalance in RE development is caused by the influence of a country's legal system, which determines the regulatory and business ethos that impacts on the trajectory of investment, and by the varying degrees of accountability implicit in a country's governance environment. Our research raises the implication that the opportunity costs of forgone economic gains are in direct conflict with long-term environmental goals, retarding the transition from carbon-based to sustainable sources of energy, and provides insights into how development can be stimulated by fiscal incentives, favourable regulations, societal engagement, improved access to finance and the alignment of national strategies. Our findings contribute to the economic literature of legal origin theory and establish fundamental principles for refining global RE development strategy and confronting the challenge of climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

 'We consolidate and comprehensively review the international business (IB) literature on the firm-specific advantages (FSAs) of emerging market multinational enterprises (EM MNEs). We do so through a systematic examination of 88 empirical and conceptual articles published in top-ranked IB journals between 2011 and 2018. The results reveal that in the past decades, EM MNEs have acquired several of the same FSAs as their counterparts in developed countries (developed country enterprises or DC MNEs) - financial resources, technologies, marketing capabilities, brand equity, R&D intensity, and management competencies. However, more recently, EM MNEs have developed additional unique FSAs in the form of managerial capabilities - to cope with competition in uncertain and constantly changing environments; easy access to cheaper capital; a stronger commitment to networks, such as those with diaspora communities; and, political connections. These additional FSAs have catalyzed the internationalization of EM MNEs. Our study also shows that some hurdles remain in the IB literature on FSAs. For instance, while IB scholars agree that EM MNEs have different investment motives depending on whether they invest in other emerging economies or developed economies, scholars are silent on the exact FSAs necessary to make EM MNEs investments in the respective economies successful. To advance the IB literature, we present some promising future research areas and challenge scholars to pursue further empirical studies on the FSAs of EM MNEs. © 2020, The Author(s).',
 'The rapid reshaping of the global economic order requires fundamental shifts in international business scholarship and management practice. New forms of protectionist policies, new types of internationalization motives, and new tools of techno-nationalism may lead to what we call “bifurcated governance” at the macro-level and “value chain decoupling” at the micro-level. As a result, innovation networks will require novel reconfigurations. We examine the emerging constraints on multinational enterprises, imposed by a bifurcated world order. We also discuss how the dynamic capabilities framework can guide scholars and managers alike to achieve new forms of evolutionary fitness. © 2019, The Author(s).',
 'Existing research into retailers’ foreign market exits has uncovered a number of drivers that lead multinational retailers to divest from certain countries. While scholars have investigated these drivers in isolation from one another, combinations of drivers that affect divestment decisions simultaneously remain under-researched despite scholars having indicated their importance and having called for a detailed, more holistic analysis. In this study, using a case study approach and qualitative content analysis of a wide variety of publicly available contemporary documents from different perspectives and experts, we investigate the drivers leading to all 32 country exits of the 50 largest grocery retailers in Europe in the 5-year period between 2014 and 2018. In line with previous research, the study shows the most frequent exit drivers are a low performance of the subsidiary, a low performance of the parent company, and a strategic refocus of the parent company. However, we demonstrate that for most exits, combinations of multiple interrelated drivers at the subsidiary level, the host-country level, and the parent level have a joint influence on retailers’ decisions to exit foreign markets. We also show that exits often include both failure-related drivers and strategy-related drivers. Furthermore, using the configurational approach, we identify exemplary combinations of market exit drivers that occur frequently and propose five archetypes of such combinations that suffice to explain all market exits in the dataset. For future research, we propose extending our typology through the application of a similar approach to different contexts and to use quantitative research based on the qualitative findings to generate more generalizable results. © 2021, The Author(s).',
 "This article discusses the shifting boundaries of inclusion and exclusion of migrant workers in trade unions. Drawing on the example of Luxembourg, an EU Member State with a long history of international migrations, the article examines the relationship between free movement of labour and the unionization of migrant workers before analysing the degree to which migrant workers' access to social rights is accompanied by their access to effective decision-making rights in trade unions. Trade unions have used European regulations on the free movement of labour as a legal infrastructure to develop services for migrant workers. At the same time, the free movement of labour and equality of treatment have come to permeate trade union strategies and rhetoric. However, with regard to the inclusion of migrant workers in decision-making processes and access to leadership positions, numerous obstacles to effective participation by migrant workers persist. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
 'This study explores the interdependence of big data analytics (BDA) capabilities and the impact of these capabilities on firm performance using an integrated multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology. Drawing on a rich data set obtained from selected case study firms in Pakistan, three MCDM tools, namely, intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evolution laboratory (IF-DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and simple additive weighting (SAW), are employed to assess the relative importance of BDA capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities with the firm performance. The results show that BDA capabilities are interdependent, and infrastructure capabilities are the highest-ranked among all, followed by management and human resource capabilities, respectively. The SAW results indicate an association between BDA capabilities and firm performance. Moreover, BDA capabilities are more strongly related to operational performance than to market performance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
 "Social software challenges strategic thinking in important ways: empowering creative, independent individuals implies indeterminate and uncertain reactions and creations in support of, or in opposition to, management's original thinking. We build a framework that organizes research on social software, taking perspectives from both inside and outside companies. We use this framework to introduce the contributions to this special issue in terms of strategy, technology, and community and to ask a series of questions for strategy research that pays particular attention to value creation and appropriation, the role of technology both as tool and mediator between managers and users, and the role that management can play in communities, both as leaders and in shaping boundaries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",
 'Reshoring can be theorized as a brand-revitalizing process for fostering companies’ ability to create value in the home country. The question of how to maintain sustainable reshoring implementation strategies by developing favourable brand responses is an important but underexplored field. Given that reshoring brand meanings are socially constructed and causally inferenced by consumers, we advocate that a reshoring brand revitalization should begin by understanding what constitutes customers’ attributions to reshoring motives. We identify values-driven, stakeholder-driven and strategic-driven attributions as determinants of the sense of the institutionalization process (brand authenticity, legitimacy and sustainability). These institutional logics comprise drivers that influence brand love and brand advocacy. We conduct an empirical study (n = 1043) in China. The findings indicate that institutionalized reshoring branding activity is significantly influenced by customers’ attributions to underlying reshoring decisions. Reshoring brands that achieve institutional recognition are more likely to generate brand love and advocacy. In addition, our study provides empirical evidence that nostalgia (1)\xa0strengthens the influences of stakeholder-driven attributions on brand authenticity and sustainability, (2) inhibits the influence of values-driven attributions on brand authenticity and (3) inhibits the influence of strategic-driven attributions on brand authenticity, legitimacy and sustainability. Reshoring brand managers should consider these connections when designing their reshoring implementation strategies in the home country. © 2023 British Academy of Management.',
 'Although start-ups’ survival has been widely investigated, only few studies have focussed on the impact of the combined effect of firms’ internal resources. Drawing upon the resource-based view (RBV), we selected four internal resources influencing start-ups’ survival (R&D activity, advertising activity, export activity, and human capital) and we applied the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine which interactions among the said internal resources affect start-ups’ survival. We used a unique dataset of 38 start-ups accelerated in Italy in 2013. Our findings suggest that, among the various combinations of internal resources considered, the interaction between export activity and human capital is the only one that affects start-ups’ survival. On one hand, the interaction between these two resources amplifies the effect of the learning by exporting on start-ups’ survival. On the other hand, export activity provides the knowledge necessary to exploit the potential of qualified human capital. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',
 'Entrepreneurs attempt to persuade potential investors that their new ventures are both credible and worthy of funding. A long line of research on entrepreneurial impression management establishes that the ability to present their ventures in a favorable light is a key attribute of successful entrepreneurs. In this study, we examine the opposite side of the issue and test to determine if some entrepreneurs obscure corporate governance information. We create a new metric to measure the level of camouflage used in governance documents for initial public offerings (IPOs). We find that entrepreneurs are less likely to use camouflage during periods of high scrutiny, as measured by industry analyst following, industry concentration levels, and IPO clustering. We also find that greater use of camouflage is associated with raising more capital, due to both greater offer proceeds as well as less underpricing. This effect is most pronounced in corporate charters which are difficult for shareholders to change. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.',
 'The turn of the 21st century has seen the burst of research on how design can support strategy formation and execution; however, little attention has been placed on the emerging field of design-driven foresight, that is the combined adoption of design and foresight methods to generate more immersive, experiential, and engaging representations of the future and inform strategy-making. This paper further unpacks this domain by examining the mechanisms that connect design-driven foresight with strategy articulation through relying on experiential learning. By drawing on a three-year research and innovation project, we illustrate how the relevant stakeholders make use of design-driven foresight processes while co-creating some interactive technologies needed to support crowdsourced curatorial processes in cultural heritage. The empirical evidence suggests how design-driven foresight, through co-creation workshops, can support experiential learning in the form of three distinct processes: favouring knowledge translation mechanisms, creating a safe space for learning-by-doing, and facilitating a multi-stakeholder conversation anchored to material and tangible work embedded in design artefacts. In turn, experiential learning can support processes of strategy articulation that emerge while stakeholders tinker with multiple exploitation pathways and progress through alternating phases of convergent and divergent thinking. Finally, it is argued that the plasticity and openness of design artefacts adopted in the context of foresight support forms of learning that will eventually foster processes of strategy articulation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd',
 "In response to the economic downturn following the recent financial crisis, the automobile industry switched to 're-insourcing'. The objective of this paper is to explore underlying motives and decision-making in manufacturing strategy, especially with regard to re-insourcing in the automobile industry. While there has been a lot of research on the topic of 'outsourcing', its opposite has not been researched widely. Even though there are some papers on the automobile manufacturing industry, a deeper industrial insight into re-insourcing is missing. Owing to the increased amount of re-insourcing implemented during the economic crisis, the latter lends itself well to gaining a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Six case studies - three of automobile manufacturers and three of automobile suppliers - with in-depth interviews are provided and consequently interpreted. All case studies indicate that the crisis had a significant influence on manufacturing-strategic decisions. Underutilized capacities appear to be a dominant motive for re-insourcing. Differences between automobile manufacturers and automobile suppliers become apparent with regard to both, motives and decision-making. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",
 "'Strategy-as-practice' (s-a-p) scholars have urged us to attend to the messy realities of strategy so as to increase the relevance of research for practititoners. This article, whilst recognizing the need to focus on what managers do, develops a critique of this literature. It argues that the s-a-p approach (Whittington, Jarzabkowski, Johnson, Balogun) and the earlier 'Power School' (Mintzberg, Pettigrew, Pfeffer) share much in common as both present power as the possession of management. This overstates the ability of managers to control others whilst understating the scope for resistance. Second, it asserts that both approaches would benefit from greater sensitivity towards the unequal context through which strategies emerge and that they serve, in part, to reproduce. Third, the article provides an empirical study of strategy in a UK Building Society. It attends to how power is exercised in ambiguous and contradictory ways that both supports and thwarts managerial endeavours. Through considering the uncertainty that results from this, the case reflects on the possibilities for resistance. The central argument is that if we explore practice only from management's perspective, then we are in danger of not only reinforcing the status quo but also of being irrelevant to practitioners and wider constituents. © The Author(s), 2009.",
 'We craft a historically sensitive model of entrepreneurship linking individual actors to the evolving social structures they must navigate to acquire resources and launch new ventures. Theories of entrepreneurship and industry evolution suggest two opposing hypotheses: as an industry develops, launching a new venture may become more difficult for all but industry insiders and the socially prominent because of competition from large incumbents, or it may become easier for all people because the legitimacy accorded to the industry simplifies the entrepreneurial task. To test these two conflicting claims, we study the American magazine industry from 1741 to 1860. We find that magazine publishing was originally restricted to publishing-industry insiders, professionals, and the highly educated, but most later founders came from outside publishing and more were of middling stature. Gains by entrepreneurs from the social periphery, however, were uneven: most were doctors and clergy without college degrees in small urban areas; magazines founded by industry insiders remained predominant in the industry centers. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of grounding studies of entrepreneurship in historical context. It also shows that entrepreneurship scholars must attend to temporal shifts within the focal industry and in society at large. © The Author(s) 2012.',
 'An epistemic fault line separating positive from normative concepts underlies theories of corporate governance. I analyze this fault line in order to show the importance of clarifying normative assumptions in governance models.

 "Although organizational environments are a central concern for researchers in organization theory and strategy, many researchers report that informant assessments and archival measures of the environment do not converge. This study investigates whether the observed divergence can be attributed to perceptual error, to real differences in constructive definitions, to differences between a firm's environment and an aggregate industry environment, or simply to methodological artifacts. Results show that environmental uncertainty and environmental variation are distinct multidimensional constructs even when only informant measures from the same respondents are considered, and that organizational level mediating filters are more strongly related to informant measures of environmental variation than to environmental uncertainty. However, the effects of individual level filters on environmental variation do not decrease after controlling for organizational level filters. We conclude that, although there are some real differences between informant and archival measures of the environment, the possibility of perceptual bias cannot be ruled out. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

 "In recent years, social enterprise issues have developed rapidly both in Taiwan and around the world. Consequently, social enterprises utilize several different business models and are hybrid organizations that need to pursue both profit and a social mission and to adopt good practices in their operations. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among social mission, service quality and brand image in a social enterprise. Data were collected from 316 customers by Come True Coffee in February 2018. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to examine the relationships among the research variables and identify the final model. The results show that the social mission improves the service quality and brand image. Moreover, the social mission of a social enterprise is an important issue in terms of encouraging consumers to feel concern. Finally, service quality is a moderating factor for a social mission in regard to brand image. The outcomes of this study could help a social enterprise's managers better understand the relationships among the social mission, service quality and brand image. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
 "Previous studies suggest that a proper fit between business strategy and human resource management can enhance a firm's financial performance. Building on prior findings, this study proposes that an ideal match could occur on the choice of international adaptation strategy and immigrant effect (IE). This match would have a significant effect on firms' financial performance. The proposed framework is examined using the experience of 121 firms operating across the Greater China region in the home-host and cross-market scenarios. It is found that the extent of adaptation strategy is positively associated with the choice of IE in both home-host and cross-market scenarios and that IE has significant direct and indirect effects on market share and profitability in the cross-market scenario. This study proposes a new strategy-human resource management-performance framework. The findings established provide some implications for researchers and managers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

We draw on management research to explain why it has been so difficult to improve quality of care, despite a burgeoning body of scientific evidence on practices that result in better outcomes and the widespread adoption of quality-improving innovations based on those practices. Our analysis points to the prevalence of innovation implementation failure-organizational members' inconsistent or improper use of innovations-as a primary cause. In our review, we identify the organizational sources of this failure and offer six strategies for avoiding innovation implementation failure in health care. Copyright by ihe Academy of Management.",
 'The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers’ use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs’ expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies',
 'What happens when multinational enterprises (MNEs) face competition in their own home market from imports or through foreign direct investment (FDI)? We provide a differentiated assessment of the influence of these two types of foreign competition on the product and geographic scope of MNEs. We apply the awareness-motivation-capability framework to international business (IB), hypothesizing that an increase or decrease in scope depends on the motivation and ability of an incumbent firm to respond to an incursion into its home market, and on the objectives and commitment of the firm that is entering that market. We assessed the scope changes of 407 large US firms between 1987 and 2003, and found that increasing imports led to scope reduction, while increasing FDI had the opposite effect. Our analysis of 95 large German firms for the same period led to similar, but somewhat less consistent, results. © 2009 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.',
 'While firms have increasingly adopted environmentally and socially sustainable management strategies, little is known about how these organizations react during times of economic constraint. On the one hand, conventional wisdom suggests that firms\' sustainability strategy would be de-emphasized. However, emerging scholarship suggests that many firms may increase their sustainability investments during constrained economic times. Building on the articles comprising this Special Issue, we offer notable evidence that firms tend to shift their sustainability strategy in innovative ways that enable them to do more with less and increase firm value without undertaking significant cutbacks. Specifically, we argue that, during times of economic constraint, firms a) engage in sustainability "trimming" to adapt to their new economic setting; b) use trimming to compete more effectively; and c) trim in ways that are path dependent, building upon prior complementary capabilities and resources. We formulate an explanation for these novel findings and conclude with observations about future research opportunities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.',
 'In-store promotions are a highly effective marketing tool that can have a significant impact on revenue. In this research, we study the question of dynamic promotion planning in the face of Bounded-Memory Peak-End demand models. In order to determine promotion strategies, we establish that a High-Low pricing policy is optimal under diagonal dominance conditions (so that the current period price dominates both past period price effects and competitive product price effects on the demand), as well as conditions on the price dispersion. We show that finding the optimal High-Low dynamic promotion policy is NP-hard in the strong sense. Nevertheless, for the special case of promotion planning for a single item, we propose a compact Dynamic Programming (DP) approach that can find the optimal promotion plan that follows a High-Low policy in polynomial time. When the diagonal dominance conditions do not hold, and, hence, a High-Low policy is not necessarily optimal, we show that the optimal High-Low policy that is found by our proposed DP can find a provably near-optimal solution. Using the proposed DP as a subroutine, for the case of multiple items, we propose a Polynomial-Time-Approximation Scheme (PTAS) that can find a solution that can capture at least 1 − ε of the optimal revenue and runs in time that is exponential only in 1=ε. Finally, we test our approach on data from large retailers and demonstrate an average of 5:1 − 15:6% increase in revenue relative to the retailer’s current practices. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS.',
 "Internationalization's role on firm performance has captured massive research attention. However, its influence on firms' default risk, an important firm outcome that not only reflects the backward-looking firm managerial effectiveness but also signifies the forward-looking willingness-to-support from key stakeholders such as debt holders, is not found in the literature. This current research is developed to fill this important theoretical gap by formulating a moderating model that simultaneously incorporates internationalization, environmental dynamism, and marketing capability towards their dynamic joint effects on global firms' default vulnerability, and thus it generates more detailed and realistic images of internationalization under the influences of concurrent internal and external contingency factors. Our results show that high marketing capability assists firms that have a high degree of global expansion to reduce default risk. In addition, environmental dynamism can be either a facilitator or hindrance for internationalization's risk reduction, depending on firm capability levels. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
 'According to the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE), the majority of innovative start-ups take advantage of the knowledge originated in incumbent firms or universities. However, little is known on how innovative start-ups’ heterogeneous originating contexts affect their performance differences at founding. To address this gap, we complement the KSTE with the resource-based view of the firm to hypothesize how the origin of innovative start-ups affects their initial technological knowledge and, in turn, performance at founding. We test the model using a sample of 338 innovative start-ups. Our results show that innovative start-ups that originated from university report a performance advantage since, right from their origin, their technological knowledge displays a broad scope and higher levels of newness. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.',
 'This study investigates the relationship between top management team (TMT) innovation orientation and new product portfolio performance in small and medium-sized family firms by exploring two family firm-specific sources of TMT diversity as moderators: the number of generations involved in the TMT and the ratio of family members in the TMT. Results indicate that family-induced diversity in the TMT has opposing moderating effects. Although a positive relationship exists between TMT innovation orientation and new product portfolio performance when multiple generations are involved in the TMT, TMT innovation orientation and new product portfolio performance experience a negative relationship when the ratio of family members in the TMT is high.

 'There exists a need to further examine capabilities that enable emerging market international new ventures (INVs) to create innovation offerings that drive performance. Although conceptual studies highlight the importance of reconfiguration capability towards innovation and performance, such relationships in the emerging market INV context require further empirical analysis. Moreover, there is a conflict in the literature as to whether reconfiguration capability supports innovation and performance directly or indirectly. As the pursuit of opportunities beyond domestic borders is central to INV research, opportunity creation is a key inquiry to advance our understanding of how reconfiguration capability facilitates innovation and performance in the emerging market INV context. Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory and creation theory, we empirically examine the interplay between reconfiguration capability, opportunity creation, innovation, and international performance. In addition, we study opportunity creation as a mediator between reconfiguration capability towards innovation and performance, respectively. The findings reveal reconfiguration capability does not directly support innovation but does shape innovation through opportunity creation. Reconfiguration capability directly supports performance objectives of emerging market INVs, and indirectly through opportunity creation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd',
 "Despite its many benefits, firms may not conduct exploration because of inhibitive costs. We maintain that offshoring provides a cost-leveraging strategy that can help firms overcome this constraint, and enhance their R&D performance with increased exploration. Empirical evidence supports our thesis: first, firms that offshore more of their R&D activities to developing countries engage in greater exploration; second, the degree to which firms benefit from offshoring is contingent on their R&D intensity, such that firms with lower levels of R&D intensity enjoy greater benefits from offshoring for exploration than those with higher levels; and third, greater exploration confers an R&D performance advantage to firms where greater exploration increases firms' successes in preclinical trials. Our study offers two implications: (1) what drives firms' exploration is not just what they can do (competencies), but also what they can afford to do (costs); and (2) offshoring enhances exploration, which, in turn, increases R&D performance. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",
 'We employ a historical case narrative of the Indian telephony sector to inductively develop a process model of institutional change in an industry within an emerging economy.

We demonstrate how these institutional dynamics impact entrepreneurial activity and explicate the role of the state as a constrained institutional entrepreneur in these scenarios. In highlighting the contested and capricious nature of such migration, we make contributions to the institutions-based view of strategy and entrepreneurship and the institutional logics and institutional entrepreneurship literatures. © 2013 Strategic Management Society.',
 'Organizations typically rely on their employees to provide high-quality service as a strategy for sustaining a competitive advantage. However, service-related jobs can have deleterious effects on employees—including negative health and attitudinal outcomes, such as burnout and decreased motivation—which also carry ramifications for organizations, including turnover. How might organizations mitigate these consequences? We posit that organizations can equip managers to create work environments conducive to employee motivation and performance because managers have substantial influence over the context within which service-oriented behaviors occur. Thus, drawing on social information processing theory and theory on work motivation, we build and test a path model that explains how and why an important type of leadership behavior—initiating structure leadership—enhances employees’ service performance and reduces collective turnover. Our multilevel analyses using multisource lagged data reveal that initiating structure leader behavior creates a high-quality service climate, which then influences meaningfulness at the individual and work-unit levels. At the individual level, our results show that employee motivation of meaningfulness positively relates to supervisor-rated employee service performance. Finally, results show that collective meaningfulness negatively relates to objective collective turnover as obtained from company archival records. Theoretical and practical implications of our study are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.',

 "Strategic tools are indispensible for business and competitive analysis. Yet we know very little about managers' internal logic as they put these tools into practical use. We situate our study in a business school context using action learning prior to the manifestation of practice to complement our understanding of practice. Using Personal Construct Theory and Repertory Grids, our mid-range theorizing showed that, contrary to current thinking about strategic tools, managers think in dualities (often paradoxically) and have a preference for multiple-tools-in-use, tools that provide different perspectives, peripheral vision, connected thinking, simultaneously help differentiate and integrate complex issues, and guide the thinking process. These findings are important for designing better tools and the nurturing of critical managerial competencies needed for a complicated world. Our study's focus also has wider implications for scholars as we see our own material evaluated by those who will put these lessons into practice. © 2012 The Authors.

 'We explore how the initial market positioning of entrepreneurial ventures shapes how they professionalize over time, focusing specifically on the development of functional roles. In contrast to existing literature, which presumes a uniform march toward professionalization as ventures scale and complete developmental milestones, we advance a contingent perspective, distinguishing between the development of external interface functions (marketing & sales and customer development) and internal process functions (accounting, human resources, and finance). Specifically, we argue that positioning in an unconventional market space raises demand for external engagement that focuses ventures’ attention and resources toward developing external interface roles. At the same time, such unconventional ventures are less apt to elaborate their internal process roles relative to more conventional peers. We test these predictions using a novel longitudinal data set on the internal organizations of 3,748 U.S.-based entrepreneurial ventures. In contrast to common assumptions of convergent professionalization, our theory and findings advance the perspective that ventures pursue divergent professionalization paths based on their initial market positioning as they scale up. © 2022 The Author(s)',
 'As digital technologies pervade established industries, their constituent firms are likely to become technologically dependent upon industry outsiders due to increased mobility of strategic resources and porosity of inter-industry boundaries. We conceptually study this global phenomenon and argue that firms in established industries mitigate their cross-industry resource dependence arising from digitalization via corporate venturing. Unlike their larger counterparts, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in established industries may pursue alternatives to traditional corporate venturing practices such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, or corporate venture capital investments. Specifically, we propose that SMEs may use acquihiring as a response to mitigate their technological dependence on digital outsiders. This study conceptualizes the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” of acquihiring by SMEs in established industries. In doing so, it contributes to the literature on cross-industry M&A strategies for SMEs in the digital era, entrepreneurial exits, and novel modes of corporate venturing. © 2022 International Council for Small Business.',
 'Realistic evaluation emphasizes the importance of exploring the mechanisms through which organizational interventions are effected. A well-known mechanism in organizational interventions is the screening process. Standardized questionnaires, in popular use, neither consider individuals’ appraisals of working conditions nor the specific context of the workplace. Screening with items tailored to intervention contexts may overcome the limitations of standardized questionnaires. In the present study, we evaluate an approach to develop a tailored questionnaire to measure employees’ appraisals of their specific working conditions. First, we interviewed 56 employees and 17 managers and, later, developed tailored items focused on the working conditions in a postal service. In follow-up interviews, we explore participants’ experiences with the tailored questionnaire, including the development of initiatives, compared with their previous experiences with the company’s annual attitude survey that used standardized scales. Results indicated that participants felt the tailored questionnaire highlighted issues that had previously been ignored, that initiatives were easier to develop owing to its specificity and that the feedback strategy was useful in prioritizing questionnaires. Overall, it can be concluded that tailored questionnaires may be appropriate for use in organizational intervention research and more broadly that evaluations of organizational interventions need to be contextually grounded. © The Author(s) 2014.',
 'We study mergers between firms operating in data-connected markets: the data generated as a byproduct of the activity in market A can be used by firms operating in market B. The effects of such a merger depend on whether data trade among independent firms is possible and whether data use benefits consumers or leads to more surplus extraction. When data increases product B’s quality, the merger benefits consumers in both markets if data cannot be traded absent the merger and harms them otherwise. When data are used to extract consumer surplus in market B, the merger increases consumer surplus in market A and reduces it in market B. © 2024 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

 'In this article, we argue that firms in high-margin industries can benefit from founding family influence. Specifically, in more profitable markets, the influence of the founding family provides an additional corporate governance-monitoring function. The sample consists of 294 firm-year observations from 98 publicly traded companies headquartered in Sweden, representing approximately half of all non-financial traded firms.

 'The positive impact of social capital on a variety of outcomes is well documented. The relational aspect of social capital, however, is relatively underexplored, especially with respect to its strategic antecedents. In this paper, we contribute to the family firm and general strategy literature by studying three strategic approaches – market, entrepreneurship and learning orientation – and their impact on relational capital. In consideration of the idiosyncrasies of family firms that shape their strategic foci and potential advantages that such businesses have in leveraging strategies to competitive advantages, we investigate the differences in the strength of these effects between family and non-family businesses. The hypothesized relationships are tested using regression analysis on a sample of 360 family and non-family firms in Mexico. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.',
 'Digital platforms have been developing fast which transform the benefits and costs of rapid internationalization of firms on them. Employing transaction cost economics perspective, we argue that the transaction attributes of asset specificity, transaction uncertainty, and transaction frequency, have all changed fundamentally in digital platform-based transactions. They render the organizational learning in rapid Internet exporting to counterbalance the diseconomies of time compression caused by the lack of organizational absorptive capacity. By using the three attributes as underlying mechanisms, we hypothesize that the expansion speed of exporters on digital platforms reduces exit hazards of the exporters. We further hypothesize that digital signals on product quality strengthen the main effect. As for digital infrastructure, we recognize its competing effects and make curvilinear moderating hypotheses. Survival analyses based on 353,636 entries of real transaction records from a digital exporting platform have provided robust findings. This study highlights the importance of examining how the digital platform reshapes the transaction attributes and internationalization-performance relationship. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd',
 "It is known that small firms rely mainly on the CEO's individual knowledge for developing innovations. Recent work suggests that this approach is inefficient since it underutilizes other employees' knowledge. We study to which extent using CEOs, managers and non-managerial employees' ideas enhances small firms' innovation performance. A Heckman selection model on 305 small firms shows that not only CEO's and managers', but also non-managerial employees' ideas contribute to innovation performance. However, contributions depend heavily on the individuals' area of expertise and on whether product or process innovation is desired. Our findings enrich the current view on the entrepreneurial team, but also warn against the implementation of one-size-fits-all employee involvement programs in small firms. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",
 'In countries with secure property rights, corporate transparency improves investment efficiency and increases growth by alleviating information asymmetry. However, in countries with insecure property rights, greater transparency can increase the risk of government expropriation. Therefore some firms that would benefit most from transparency cannot take full advantage of it, as they set sub-optimal transparency levels. Using data from 59 industries in 69 countries, we find that in countries with weak property rights protection, industries that would benefit the most from transparency exhibit worse investment efficiency and grow more slowly than industries that can efficiently operate at minimal levels of transparency. © 2009 Academy of International Business All rights reserved.',
 'This study adopts the upper echelon and competitive dynamics perspectives to investigate the mechanisms by which strategic human resource management (SHRM) can create a competitive advantage for a firm. Top management team (TMT) social integration and action aggressiveness are identified as internal-oriented and external-oriented capabilities, respectively, for a teamwork-oriented executive SHRM system to support in enhancing firm performance. Structural equation modeling is performed to test hypothesized relationships. Statistical results demonstrate TMT social integration and action aggressiveness in sequence partially mediate the relationship of an executive SHRM system and firm performance. Action aggressiveness partially mediates the relationship of TMT social integration and firm performance. This study provides further insights into the SHRM, upper echelon, and competitive dynamics perspectives. The research findings also serve to remind top executives to remain alert in developing a set of teamwork-focused executive SHRM practices, building an integrated team, and proactively shaping competitive actions to outperform rivals. © 2008 Sage Publications.',

 "Firms choose foreign market entry timing strategies based on their perceptions and evaluations of the risks and rewards inherent with early versus late entry into that market. We expect a firm's home country culture to have a strong impact on these perceptions, resulting in systematic variation in firm entry timing strategies across firms' country of origin. To this perspective, we integrate extant research which suggests that the host country political environment will also impact entry timing. Our findings support the argument that home country cultural attributes directly influence whether a firm decides to enter a country earlier or later than other firms, and that the host country's political environment moderates these effects. Specifically, we find that firms from high performance orientation and high power distance tend to enter countries earlier on average; we also find that countries with weak political freedoms trigger late-entry strategies for firms from high uncertainty avoidance cultures, but early-entry strategies for firms from collectivist cultures. Our findings are the first in the entry timing literature to examine the role of a firm's home country cultural attributes and underscore the importance of the cultural and political environments on strategic decision-making across diverse home and host country contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",
 "• Knowledge is critical for creating and sustaining competitive advantage and in today's fastmoving international market firms need to leverage knowledge globally. Therefore, one important question becomes what effect different transfer mechanisms have on transfer success. • This study investigates 169 international knowledge transfer projects in multinational corporations focusing on the role of hierarchy, heterarchy and IT in terms of effects on knowledge transfer success, that is, efficiency and effectiveness of the transfer project. • We find that the effects of the different integrative and coordinative structures on knowledge transfer success are contradictory. Centralization through headquarters involvement is negatively related to knowledge transfer success in both its dimensions, while previous cooperation between subsidiaries has positive effects on transfer effectiveness, but not on efficiency. The use of IT nurtures knowledge transfer success in both dimensions. • This study adds to the knowledge about the effects of vertical and lateral mechanisms on the success of knowledge transfer projects. © Gabler-Verlag 2011.",
 "Some private small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in transition economies have actively internationalized. This decision needs to accommodate institutional conditions that vary, not only between countries, but also within an individual country.

 'Despite the interest in issues of knowing and learning in the global strategy field, there has been limited mutual engagement and interaction between the fields of global strategy and organizational learning. The purpose of our article is to reflect on and articulate how the mutual exchange of ideas between these fields can be encouraged. To this end, we first conduct a review of the intersection of the fields of global strategy and organizational learning. We then present two recommendations regarding how the interaction between the two fields can be enhanced. Our first recommendation is for global strategy research to adopt a broader notion of organizational learning. Our second recommendation is for global strategy research to capitalize on its attention to context in order to inform and enhance organizational learning theory. We discuss the use of context in a number of common research designs and highlight how the scope for theoretical contributions back to organizational learning varies with the research design that is adopted. © 2015 Strategic Management Society.',
 'New Public Management (NPM) has been guiding public sector reform for over 25 years. Its position on the design of effective management control rests on three key ideas: (1) performance improvement requires a results-oriented culture that emphasizes outcomes rather than inputs or processes; (2) public sector organizations need to introduce performance management based on targets, monitoring and incentives; and (3) public sector organizations should decentralize decision rights and reduce their reliance on rules and procedures. Focusing on the particularly influential version of NPM as advocated by the OECD, we examine the validity of these ideas theoretically and empirically. We conclude that NPM’s reform programme should be reconsidered. Although the evidence indicates that a results-oriented culture is positively associated with performance, we find little support for the assumed benefits of NPM-type performance contracting. In addition, the results suggest that both the effects of decentralization and the reliance on rules and procedures are opposite to NPM’s expectations. © The Author(s) 2015.',
 "This article analyses the relationship between violence, the transition from apartheid, and contemporary state formation in South Africa. Through an ethnographic case study of the rural area of Umbumbulu outside Durban in KwaZulu-Natal, the article argues that prevailing interpretations of violence that focus on rivalry between political parties obscure the ways in which other factors - such as local power struggles among customary leaders and strongmen, state support for the rise of warlords, and the recruitment of young men through kinship and patronage networks - helped spread the violence. Local strongmen or warlords were motivated by the quest for power and economic success in their local communities as well as their beliefs in and strategic alliances with national-level political parties engaged in the struggle to end apartheid. In particular, the article focuses on a 'faction fight' in the mid-1980s and the subsequent violence that surrounded two warlords affiliated to the African National Congress in a region that was mostly dominated by Inkatha supporters. The alliances the ANC made with these warlords continued into the post-apartheid period and helped shape the ways in which power was exercised within the new political institutions of the democratic state. © The Author 2013.

 'Even though the financial literature has examined the relation between the composition of the board of directors and firms’ performances, few studies have investigated the effect of adopting a specific corporate governance system. Past studies have not found clear evidence of the superiority of a specific corporate governance system in terms of economic and financial performances; instead, they have generally been limited to legal systems where the adoption of a specific system is mandatory. In this paper, we take into consideration the case of the Italian Corporate Law Reform, which gives firms the opportunity to choose, in a non-mandatory way, between different governance systems and in particular between a one-tier model and the pre-existing system prior to the Reform. Using propensity score matching and focusing on a sample of unlisted Italian joint-stock companies, we found evidence of a significant worsening of performances from 2003 to 2013 for corporations adopting a one-tier board after the Reform. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.', "Research summary: This study examines how managerial biases in the form of overconfidence change the interpretation of performance feedback and, consequently, shape a firm's risk taking in response to it. Our formal analysis suggests that CEO overconfidence is associated with a lower willingness to increase firm risk taking when facing negative performance feedback and a higher willingness to decrease risk when facing positive feedback. An extension of our model also shows that, when firms are operating close to their survival level, the effects of CEO overconfidence will reverse. We test our predictions empirically with a sample of 847 American manufacturing firms in the years 1992 to 2014. Our results are consistent with our hypotheses and are robust to different empirical operationalizations of CEO overconfidence. Managerial summary: Managers evaluate the success of their current business strategy through feedback in the form of their firm's current financial results relative to their own previous performance or that of their peers. Our results show that overconfident CEOs interpret information about the financial situation of their firms more optimistically than non-overconfident CEOs, which in turn causes them to exhibit a less pronounced reaction to both positive or negative performance feedback. It is thus crucial that managers are clearly aware of how their interpretations and reactions to feedback are affected by their own deeply held personal beliefs and dispositions. © 2020 The Authors.

       "A firm that manages for stakeholders allocates more resources to satisfy the needs and demands of its legitimate stakeholders than would be necessary to simply retain their willful participation in the firm's productive activities. We explain why this sort of behavior unlocks additional potential for value creation, as well as the conditions that either facilitate or disrupt the value-creation process. Firms that manage for stakeholders develop trusting relationships with them based on principles of distributional, procedural, and interactional justice. Under these conditions, stakeholders are more likely to share nuanced information regarding their utility functions, thereby increasing the ability of the firm to allocate its resources to areas that will best satisfy them (thus increasing demand for business transactions with the firm). In addition, this information can spur innovation, as well as allow the firm to deal better with changes in the environment. Competitive advantages stemming from a managing-for-stakeholders approach are argued to be sustainable because they are associated with path dependence and causal ambiguity. These explanations provide a strong rationale for including stakeholder theory in the discussion of firm competitiveness and performance. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'What is the relationship between niche and performance? We identify two types of niche positions-product niche and process niche-defined by the extent to which a firm offers distinctive products and has distinctive operational processes, respectively. We argue that the effect of each niche on firm performance is contingent upon network embeddedness-the extent to which a firm is involved in a network of interconnected inter-firm relationships. Using data covering the period 1995-98 pertaining to venture capital firms and their holdings in initial public offerings (IPOs), we show that both product niche and process niche interact with network embeddedness to determine firm performance. Our findings suggest that the extent to which a firm offers distinctive products or processes will be more positively associated with firm performance when network embeddedness is high.

       'Research Summary: This article studies how the logic of firm governance choices varies as a function of the time of adoption of particular sourcing practices. Using data on the diffusion of global business services sourcing as a management practice from early experiments in the 1980s through 2011, we show that the extent to which governance choices are affected by process commoditization, availability of external service capabilities, and past governance choices depends on whether firms are early or late adopters. Findings inform research on governance choice dynamics specifically in highly diverse and evolving firm populations. Managerial Summary: This article considers how firms have chosen delivery models in global services sourcing decisions over time. Based on comprehensive data, we make two major observations. First, we find that firms that began with global services sourcing early, invested mainly in their internal sourcing capacity, while outsourcing only simple tasks to external providers, whereas firms that started later invested more in their capability to outsource various services to increasingly sophisticated suppliers. Second, we find that initial investments in internal or external sourcing capabilities have a strong effect on future choices of delivery models. This explains why, even today, firms vary greatly in how they implement global sourcing decisions, and it suggests that newcomers should learn from their own peer group rather than from highly experienced firms.

       "Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in the notion of capabilities as an important source of competitive advantage. This recognition has, in turn, placed emphasis on the question of where and how these capabilities emerge and how they influence firm performance. The present paper is an attempt to address this question. Using a large sample of detailed project-level data from a leading firm in the global software services industry, we attempt to empirically study the importance of capabilities. We find that two broad classes of capabilities are significant. The first class, which we label client-specific capabilities, is a function of repeated interactions with clients over time and across different projects. This learning from repeated interactions with a given client reduces project execution costs and helps improve project contribution. The second class, termed project management capabilities, is acquired through deliberate and persistent investments in infrastructure and systems to improve the firm's software development process. Our empirical results suggest that the marginal returns to acquiring different capabilities may be different and an understanding of such trade-offs can improve firm decisions to improve and/or acquire such capabilities. We discuss the key contributions of our paper and the implications for future research on capabilities. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "We elucidate the intellectual progression of the strategic management field by examining knowledge flows to and from the Strategic Management Journal (SMJ) during the period 1980-2009. We provide a detailed mapping of the evolution of the intellectual structure of the field and identify its input-output dependency relationships with other fields. Analysis of citation data using three analytic techniques: log-multiplicative model, pathfinder analysis, and entropy analysis allow us to discern strategic management's influence on and engagement with other disciplines. The results show that, within the intellectual universe of strategic management, SMJ has played a central role, both as a source and storer of knowledge. We notice that, over time, there has been a decline in practitioner orientation, greater communication with finance and sociology, and increasing linkages with international business and entrepreneurship.

       "Research summary: This article exploits a natural experiment involving self-regulation in the ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereal industry to evaluate the performance impact of product repositioning. It then examines how a product's brand equity value declines with repositioning distance and explores various nonprice responses of firms to increased own and rival competition. Self-regulation led to a crowding of the product space by forcing differentiated products to become more similar. We find that products constrained by regulation performed relatively worse than unconstrained products. Furthermore, brand equity specific to a product was tightly linked to existing product positions. Increased competition also led to increased brand equity investments and some products with strong brand equity repositioned more aggressively than those with weak brand equity. Managerial summary: This article illustrates how firms respond to newly-imposed regulatory constraints and how product brand equity is tightly linked to underlying product positions. The analysis is an empirical examination of a self-regulatory initiative that placed advertising restrictions on high sugar RTE breakfast cereal products targeted toward children. We explore the impact of the regulation on performance and then use the setting to examine the connection between brand equity and changes in product positions. Finally, we examine firm responses to rival entry that include exiting, repositioning, and increasing investments in differentiation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
       "This paper advances the debate concerning the relationship between politics and business conduct by investigating the influence of the institutional context on leveraged buyout investments. We propose that the formal and informal institution context in 'red' states (those dominated by the U.S. Republican Party) is more aligned with the principal strategies through which leveraged buyout investors create value than such a context is in 'blue' states (those dominated by the Democratic Party). Therefore, according to institutional theory, one would expect, ceteris paribus, a higher likelihood of buyout transactions in red states and vice versa. We analyze a sample of 10,746 U.S. buyout investments in 4,633 distinct target companies made by 2,396 different funds managed by 1,300 private equity firms from 1980 to 2003. The results indicate strong evidence of a positive association between a more aligned institutional context and both the volume of buyout activity and different measures of performance for these buyouts. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'A series of five Strategic Management Journal articles has debated several issues concerning the role of market orientation in shaping firm performance. This debate has defined market orientation as a cultural emphasis. Yet, a large body of research in the marketing field views market orientation as an emphasis on certain market information-processing activities. Using data from 217 firms, we test a model that includes both cultural and information-processing elements. The findings suggest that both approaches to market orientation help explain performance, but their effects are mediated by organizational responsiveness. Thus, researchers should not only account for both definitions of market orientation, but they should also investigate market orientation in combination with other Important performance antecedents.

       "This paper examines the interaction effects of institutional differences in the cognitive, normative, and regulatory domains on cross-border acquisition and alliance formation. Using a sample of 673 cross-border acquisitions and alliances conducted by multinational corporations (MNCs) from the manufacturing sector of six emerging economies (EEs) over the period 1995-2008, we find significant mimicking (cognitive domain) of local firms' choice of ownership modes by EE firms. We also find that regulatory distance (regulatory domain) moderates the mimicking of both foreign and local firms while normative distance does not have any moderating effect. These findings contribute to our understanding of how EE MNCs mimic ownership modes in foreign market entry and how the interaction of this mimetic tendency with other institutional pillars affects these decisions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

       'We investigate coordination strategies in integrating distributed work. In the context of Business Process Offshoring (BPO), we analyze survey data from 126 offshored processes to understand both the sources of difficulty in integrating distributed work as well as how organizations overcome these difficulties. We find that interdependence between offshored and onshore processes can lower offshored process performance, and investing in coordination mechanisms can ameliorate the performance impact of interdependence. In particular, we outline a distinctive set of coordination mechanisms that rely on tacit coordination-and theoretically articulate and empirically show that tacit coordination mechanisms are distinct from the well-known duo of coordination strategies: building communication channels or modularizing processes to minimize the need for communication. We discuss implications for the study of coordination in organizations. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
       "Research Summary: We examine how technological, geographical, and product market overlaps between a firm and its alliance partner influence the firm's invention performance by shaping the learning and competitive tension in an R&D alliance. Drawing on research on learning in alliances and competitive dynamics, we argue that the firm's invention performance is influenced positively by technological and geographical overlaps and negatively by product market overlap. We further argue that product market overlap negatively moderates the positive relationships between technological and geographical overlaps and the firm's invention performance. Testing our theory on a dataset of 215 R&D alliances provides support for most of our hypotheses. We discuss how our theory and findings enrich coopetition and alliance research. Managerial Summary: Prominent R&D alliances, such as between BioNtech and Pfizer or Samsung and Sony, typify coopetition—the collaboration between competing firms. In this context of coopetition, we study how a firm's invention performance is influenced by the technological, geographical, and product market overlaps it has with its R&D alliance partner. Empirical results from a sample of 215 R&D alliances formed between U.S. pharmaceutical firms confirm our theory that product market overlap is distinct from the other types of overlap: it changes the thrust of the alliance from joint value creation toward private value appropriation. This way, product market overlap not only decreases a firm's invention performance, but also weakens the positive impacts of technological and geographical overlaps on a firm's invention performance. © 2021 The Authors.

       'Research summary: This article theorizes that social capital produced by social affiliations allows service professionals to gain access to higher-value transactions through increased reputation for trustworthiness, which then aids them in further building reputation and engaging in entrepreneurship. Using a unique approach that pairs Utah residential real estate data with church congregation boundaries, we find that affiliations enable real estate agents to list 14% more expensive homes, and to consequently build reputation useful for future nonaffiliated transactions. We observe large reputation-building benefits for early-career agents, particularly for agents in low-reputation firms. Strikingly, we find this lowers entrepreneurship entry by 6%. These results imply that social affiliations can substitute for reputation in selection, enabling professionals to build reputation, which then has important career implications. Managerial summary: This article explores how social relationships between real estate agents and home sellers influence the value of transactions agents engage in. Sellers increasingly trust agents with whom they share a social affiliation, which allows agents to better secure high-value listings and build reputation. This benefits agent in securing future valuable transactions with nonaffiliated clients. Using residential real estate data and geographically assigned church congregations, we find that agents list 14% more expensive homes when listing for affiliated clients, and that this builds agent reputation significantly faster than listing for nonaffiliated clients. Interestingly, we find listing for affiliated clients reduces future entrepreneurship 6%. Our study suggests that service professionals can leverage social affiliations to build reputation that helps them establish clientele and improve performance. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',

       'We provide evidence that the presence of technical expertise in firm governance structure reduces reliance on contractual incentives to control the potential agency problem for executives whose responsibilities require specialized knowledge. Specifically, we find that firms with financial expertise in the form of a board finance committee, or a chief executive officer with a financial background, tend to use lower levels of incentive-based compensation for their chief financial officers. Our findings suggest financial experts provide stronger oversight and/or direction with regard to firm financial policies and strategies, thereby allowing firms to reduce reliance on incentive compensation.

       "From an organizational learning perspective, we argue that the information signaled by the distribution attributes of foreign investors already operating in a location will influence the entry decisions of later arrivals by affecting their level of confidence in imitating. In the context of foreign investment decisions, the proportion of experienced firms in a location was shown to first increase a follower firm's confidence about imitating them, but then to decrease it, due to anticipated competition. The impact of learning from target organizations also varies with the experience of the learning organization. Data on the location choices of 7,478 manufacturing ventures in China by U.S. firms supported the hypotheses. The results provide a more integrated and nuanced understanding of learning in foreign direct investment. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'Localization of knowledge flows has been extensively examined in the literature on innovation. However, almost all previous research has focused on technological knowledge. This study examines why knowledge of demand can also be tacit and localized. We provide a detailed empirical study of the global pharmaceutical industry and find not only that demand is as important as technological knowledge in determining the pattern of innovation in this industry but also that innovation is a locally determined phenomenon.

       "Research Summary: How does the dyadic collaborative structure between the hiring firm and the losing firm influence knowledge spillovers following an employee's move? We demonstrate that knowledge spill-ins (to the hiring firm) and spill-backs (to the losing firm) are the greatest when a firm with a strong collaborative density hires an employee from another firm that too has a strong collaborative density. Furthermore, such a dyadic combination results in the greatest degree of access to the broader knowledge of the other firm. By considering the role of relative collaborative structures in post-mobility knowledge-building activities, we inform the extant literature on the importance of this factor. In doing so, we invite scholars to take a more holistic view of the risks and benefits associated with “learning by hiring.”. Managerial Summary: Firms interested in acquiring the knowledge of other firms through employee recruitment face a dilemma. To best integrate the knowledge brought in by new employees, firms must encourage extensive collaboration between existing employees and new hires. However, such a dense collaboration exposes firms to potential knowledge spill out through these new hires, which may undermine their competitive edge. Firms that lose employees face the reverse dilemma. Accordingly, managers and practitioners should realize that not all recruitments may result in net knowledge gains. Our findings strongly suggest that where a firm hires from also matters, not just who it hires, thereby offering a practical insight for organizations in properly assessing the utility of hiring an employee, particularly in consideration of their relative collaborative structures. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
       "We examine firms' choice of organizational governance form. Using longitudinal data on a sample of business format franchisors operating in North America, we show that the cross-sectional evidence commonly used to demonstrate support for efficient contracting explanations for organizational governance form is not robust to the year of investigation, firm effects, or selection effects. We theorize that this outcome may result from dynamic processes through which a firm's organizational governance form evolves. We develop and test two hypotheses for the effects of organizational momentum on organizational governance form, and find that organizational momentum is a robust predictor. Our results suggest that researchers consider the dynamics of momentum in explaining the form of firm governance. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "In studying the antecedents of alliance performance, one stream of research has underscored the alignment between partners' characteristics whereas another has concentrated on relational mechanisms such as mutual trust, relational embeddedness, and relational commitment. We integrate these two perspectives by examining how congruence of the partners' cultures and organizational routines facilitates the emergence of relational mechanisms in non-equity alliances. Our analysis of 420 non-equity alliances in the information technology industry demonstrates how differences in partners' internal task routines undermine relational mechanisms that in turn impact alliance performance. Partners who acknowledge their latent differences can overcome some of these negative consequences. We advance alliance research by studying the performance implications of alliance partners' organizational differences and by demonstrating how these effects are mediated by relational mechanisms. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Research Summary: We apply real options (RO) theory to understand the role of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments and its relationship with internal R&D capabilities in supporting the acquisition of external technologies. We formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the option value of CVC and the decision to exercise the RO using a dyadic dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. Our findings suggest that the option value of CVC is higher for investors with weaker scientific capabilities; engaging the markets for technology in distant technological fields; and, when their innovation pipeline is tilted toward the late-stage development process. Finally, the licensing of high-value technologies is the most likely form of option exercise when technological uncertainty is reduced post-CVC. Managerial Summary: Despite the fact that one of the main goals of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments in high-tech industries is to gain a window on future technologies, the relationship between CVC and other strategies used to acquire external technologies, such as licensing, has not been adequately explored. To address this gap, we formulate hypotheses about key drivers of the decision to make CVC investments as a wait-and-see strategy in the markets for technology (MFT) using a longitudinal dataset of global pharmaceutical firms and their biotech partners. We find that investors' scientific capabilities, technological domains, and research pipelines impact investors' decisions to make CVC investments prior to other MFT transactions. In our research setting, investors typically acquire high-value technologies via licensing when technological uncertainty is reduced post-CVC. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks—strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
       "When firms seek to enter a new business segment, they have to decide how to best gain access to the required resources. This paper analyzes how resource relatedness influences a firm's decision between internal development and collaborative arrangement as modes of entry. We distinguish between a firm's capacity to transfer its established resources to the new segment (resource transferability) and the integration and synergistic combination of current firm resources with target segment resources in day-to-day operations (resource complementarity). Resource transferability makes entry by internal development more likely, but this effect depends on segment characteristics. Synergies from complementary resources can be exploited more easily within firm boundaries than across an alliance interface. However, certain partner characteristics can substitute in part for belonging to the same firm. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       'Foundational RBV work suggests that firms possess capabilities that represent strengths and others that represent weaknesses. In contrast, contemporary research has examined capability strengths while largely ignoring weaknesses. Addressing this oversight, we examine the direct and integrated effects of sets of capability strengths and capability weaknesses on competitive advantage and its empirical correlate-relative performance. Additionally, we explore how environmental and firm-specific factors influence change in these drivers of competitive advantage over time. Results suggest that weakness sets have a negative effect on relative performance, while strength sets have an increasingly positive effect. The integrative effects of strength and weakness sets affect relative performance in a complex manner. For example, while high strength/low weakness firms perform at high levels, firms integrating high strength with high weakness perform well, but experience considerably more variance in their realized outcomes. Lastly, we find that the strength and weakness sets change significantly over time in markets where competition is more intense, thereby undermining the durability of competitive advantage. Our theory and results indicate that achieving temporary advantage is more difficult than previously thought and that the erosion of advantage occurs routinely as a result of dynamic and interactive rivalry. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',
       "Research Summary: In this article, we explore how keynote speeches come into being as a staged genre of strategic communication. In our critical discursive analysis of video data on Apple Inc.'s keynote speeches, we demonstrate how keynote speeches are multimodally accomplished through the embodied enactment of four discursive practices: referencing, relating, demarcating, and mystifying. We show how different bodily movements, which we describe as leveling and leaping gestures, systematically contribute to constructing different conceptions of strategy through the enactment of these discursive practices as a staged genre of strategic communication. Our findings contribute to strategy-as-practice research by extending the nascent but growing literature on genres of strategic communication, the strategist's body in the strategy process, and the use of video-based research methods. Managerial Summary: Firms increasingly rely on keynote speeches to communicate their strategies. As a result, managers invest more and more time and effort into preparing and rehearsing their keynote speeches. But how do managers communicate strategy in these staged performances? Based on an analysis of Apple Inc.'s keynote speeches, we explore the discursive and bodily patterns that characterize this genre. In doing so, we demonstrate that the coordinated use of bodily movements in keynote speeches is consequential for highlighting different aspects of the communicated strategy. This shows that keynote speeches and other types of public speeches cannot simply be scripted, but require managers to engage in bodily rehearsal and training in order to communicate strategies effectively.

       "This study examines the extent to which subnational regions can explain foreign affiliate performance in two host country settings, the United States and China, the world's two largest economies at polar ends of the economic spectrum (i.e., an advanced versus an emerging economy). Our results suggest that the subnational region is significant in explaining foreign affiliate performance, thus confirming its importance as an additional unit of analysis for firm performance. This study also shows that the effects of subnational region are far stronger in China than they are in the United States, thus suggesting that regional differences are more critical in their explanatory power for firm performance in emerging economies than they are in advanced economies. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Research Summary: This paper examines how strategy-makers attempt to reconcile change initiatives with organizational values and principles laid out long before, still encased in strategic identity statements such as corporate mottos and philosophies. It reveals three discursive strategies that strategy-makers use to establish a sense of continuity in time of change: elaborating (transferring part of the content of the historical statement into a new one), recovering (forging a new statement based on the retrieval and re-use of historical references), and decoupling (allowing the co-existence of the historical statement and a contemporary one). By so doing, our study advances research on uses of the past, establishes important linkages between identity and strategy research, and enhances our understanding of the intergenerational transfer of values in family firms. Managerial Summary: Crafting a new corporate philosophy or mission statement can help implement strategic change, but can also be experienced as a disruption in people's sense of “who we are” as an organization. This paper reveals a variety of strategies that managers can use to deal with the tension between promoting change and maintaining a sense of continuity with a distant, revered past. By doing so, it helps managers confronting these issues deal with the enabling and constraining effects of the past. While this is a more general challenge for organizations with historical legacies, it is a particularly delicate issue for family firms grappling with the need to transfer values from one generation to the next, while retaining flexibility to change and adapt over time. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
       "Building on absorptive capacity and social network research, in this paper I investigate how individuals inside the organization use external knowledge to generate innovations. Through original sociometric data collected from 276 scientists, researchers, and engineers from the Research and Development division of a large multinational high-tech company, I show that the effects of external knowledge on individuals' innovativeness are contingent upon individuals' position in the internal social structure. In particular, results indicate that the positive effects of external knowledge on innovation generation become more positive when individuals sourcing external knowledge span structural holes in the internal knowledge-sharing network.

       'This study applies the justice theory to address interpartner cooperation in strategic alliances. It emphasizes how procedural fairness as perceived by boundary spanners in these alliances influences cooperation outcomes. We theorize that procedural fairness improves cooperation results through enhancing relational value and curtailing relational risk in an environment characterized by both economic and social exchange. Our path analysis suggests that procedural fairness has a direct effect on operational outcome, but an indirect effect on financial outcome via increased trust driven by fairness. Procedural fairness contributes more to performance outcomes when strategic alliances are equity joint ventures than if they are contractual agreements. Theoretical and managerial implications arising from the findings are highlighted. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.'];
